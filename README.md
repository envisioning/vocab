# Methodology

## Definitions

- Vocab articles are created by feeding each term into `GPT-4o` with instructions to create a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the term following a predefined style guide.

## Generality

- Each vocab term is assessed by `GPT-4o` in order to estimate its relative level of importance compared to the whole data set.
- The language model evaluates each term several times, and an average score is presented here.

## Year

- We estimate the first citation or reference of each article with `GPT-4o-mini` and sometimes `Claude 3.5`.
- These are manually compared against the time range indicated by article definitions.

## Intersimilarity

- The degree of similarity between each article pair is estimated in order to identify relationships between different concepts.

## Images

- GPT4o: Receives title and summary,
- Suggests image prompt for `FLUX 1.1 Pro`.

## Explainers

- Created generatively with `Claude 3.5 Sonnet` with significant human intervention.

## Fact Checking

- LLMs have remarkable self-knowledge. This is likely because of the amount of research papers and articles used in the training data. This minimizes the chances of hallucinations or factual mistakes, which has been validated by running most entries through a fact-checking [CustomGPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-T87zDPHN1-envisioning-ai).
