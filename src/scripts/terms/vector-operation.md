Vector operations are fundamental to AI, providing the mathematical foundation for handling data in vector spaces, an essential framework for embedding representations and transformations in ML models. These operations, including addition, subtraction, dot product, and cross product, are utilized to process and transform high-dimensional data, such as feature vectors in neural networks and support vector machines. Vectors are pivotal in creating input data for algorithms and optimizing them during training processes. Their capabilities allow AI systems to simulate linear transformations and calculate gradients vital for optimization techniques like gradient descent. Through practices such as vector space models, AI efficiently manages numerous tasks, including language representation and computer vision, facilitating both the understanding and development of complex algorithms. 

The term "vector operation" has its roots in linear algebra, which traces back to the 19th century, but it started to gain significant popularity with advancements in computer science and AI from the 1990s onwards, given its critical role in powering ML algorithms.

Key contributors to the development of vector operations in AI include figures such as Geoffrey Hinton, who advanced neural network models, where vector operations are integral, and Vladimir Vapnik, whose development of Support Vector Machines heavily relies on vector calculations. These pioneering efforts have cemented vector operations as an indispensable component in the toolkit for AI research and application.
