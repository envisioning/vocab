Fuzzy logic is a computational paradigm that facilitates reasoning under uncertainty and imprecision, extending classical binary logic to encompass a continuum of truth values between completely true and completely false. This approach is particularly significant in AI as it provides a framework for dealing with the kind of inexact information often encountered in real-world scenarios, enabling the design of systems that can emulate human cognitive processes more closely. Its applications are extensive, ranging from control systems used in household appliances to more complex decision-making processes in industrial systems and robotics. Fuzzy logic allows for incorporating expert human knowledge into AI systems constructively and intuitively, which is invaluable for applications requiring nuanced reasoning and adaptability.

The term and concept of fuzzy logic were first introduced in 1965, when it began to gain traction with the development of fuzzy set theory, aligning with the burgeoning interest in systems capable of handling ambiguity in the late 20th century.

The foundational development of fuzzy logic is attributed to Lotfi Zadeh, a pioneering figure in this field, who introduced fuzzy set theory. Zadeh's work has profoundly influenced AI by providing a versatile approach for addressing uncertainty and facilitating more human-like reasoning capabilities in machines.
