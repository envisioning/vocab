In AI, sampling is a crucial process used to manage large datasets, ensuring that analyses become computationally feasible and efficient without compromising the integrity or accuracy of the results. This technique is essential in scenarios where dealing with entire datasets is impractical due to size or computational limitations, such as in probabilistic models and Monte Carlo methods. Sampling methods, including random, stratified, and importance sampling, among others, help generate insights by selecting representative data, thus forming the basis for making predictions, probabilistic inferences, or optimizations within both supervised and unsupervised learning contexts in ML (Machine Learning). As AI systems grow in complexity, efficient sampling techniques are becoming increasingly important to retain model accuracy while optimizing for speed and computational loads.

The concept of sampling can be traced back to early statistics, however, it gained prominence within computer science and AI during the 20th century alongside the evolution of numerical methods and probabilistic algorithms. The identification and formal recognition of sampling in large-scale computation particularly grew in prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s as data processing needs expanded rapidly.

Key contributors to the development of sampling in AI include statisticians and computer scientists who have refined statistical theory and practices. Significant figures such as Jerzy Neyman, in the domain of survey sampling, laid foundational methodologies that influenced AI applications. More contemporary advancements have been shaped by researchers focusing on machine learning and probabilistic modeling, integrating these classical ideas into refined algorithms for AI.
