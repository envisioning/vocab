First introduced in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt, Perceptron Convergence is a foundational concept in neural networks, particularly significant for illustrating that simple linear classifiers can effectively find solutions for linearly separable problems. The perceptron algorithm, a type of linear classifier, iteratively adjusts weights to minimize classification error on a dataset. The Perceptron Convergence Theorem guarantees that if a dataset is linearly separable, then the perceptron algorithm will converge after a finite number of steps. This convergence provides an early demonstration of how AI systems can learn from data iteratively, paving the way for further developments in more complex neural network architectures and supervised learning methods.

The term 'Perceptron' emerged in the late 1950s and became widely recognized in AI research by the 1960s due to its implications in computational learning theory and neural networks.

Frank Rosenblatt, a psychologist, and computer scientist at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, was the key figure behind the development of the perceptron and its convergence theorem. His work laid significant groundwork for later advancements in neural network algorithms.
