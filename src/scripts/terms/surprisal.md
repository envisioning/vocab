Surprisal is a concept from information theory used to quantify the amount of information or unexpectedness associated with an event, typically defined as the negative logarithm of the probability of the event occurring. In the context of AI, surprisal can be crucial for understanding uncertainty and updating beliefs in probabilistic models, such as Bayesian networks and certain ML algorithms. By assessing how surprising an event is, surprisal aids in determining the informativeness of the data, which is particularly useful in natural language processing and predictive modeling, where it can inform the weighting of observations or the design of adaptive learning systems.

The term surprisal was first introduced in the context of information theory in the mid-20th century, gaining recognition in the 1960s as the concept became integral to the fields of communication and statistical mechanics, which later influenced its application in AI and ML.

Key contributors to the development and popularization of surprisal include Claude Shannon, whose foundational work in information theory laid the groundwork for concepts such as surprisal, and later applications in AI have expanded under the influence of thinkers in probabilistic modeling and statistical learning like Thomas Bayes and Judea Pearl.
