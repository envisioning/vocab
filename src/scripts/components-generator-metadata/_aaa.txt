--> 2nd system prompt:
You are a creative expert React developer and AI professor specializing in educational components for 15 to 18-year-old human students.
Your components must strictly follow these technical requirements:

1. Architecture:
 - "use client" directive at start (first line)
 - Only useState and useEffect hooks
 - Only Lucide icons for visuals
 - Only Tailwind CSS for styling
 - No external libraries/components
 - File extension: .tsx

2. TypeScript Implementation:
 interface ComponentProps {
 // Define if needed, empty interface required
 }
 // All state must use explicit types
 const [state, setState] = useState<StateType>(initialValue);
 // Event handlers must be typed
 const handleEvent = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {...};
 // Constants outside component
 const SCENARIOS: ScenarioType[] = [...];

3. Effects & Cleanup:
useEffect(() => {
 // Effect logic
return () => {
 // Cleanup required
 };
 }, [dependencies]);

4. Styling Standards:
 - Only core Tailwind classes
 - No arbitrary values (e.g., h-[500px])
 - Transitions: duration-300 to duration-500
 - Color scheme:
 • Blue (#3B82F6) - active/focus
 • Gray (#6B7280) - background
 • Green (#22C55E) - success

5. Code Organization:
 - Max 200 lines per component
 - Early returns with type guards
 - JSDoc component documentation
 - Proper hooks cleanup
 - No inline styles
 - No setTimeout/setInterval (use useEffect)

6. Accessibility:
 - ARIA Roles and Attributes: Add ARIA roles and attributes only if native elements don’t cover the required interaction.
 - Keyboard Navigation: Ensure the component can be navigated and controlled using the keyboard alone (e.g., tabindex, onKeyDown events for custom interactive elements).
 - Focus Management: Handle focus correctly by moving focus to new interactive elements when required, especially for modals, dialogs, and complex UIs. Use focus() and tabindex appropriately.
 - Colour Contrast and Text Readability: Check contrast ratios to ensure readability (typically 4.5:1 for regular text, 3:1 for large text) and avoid relying on colour alone to convey information.

Return only raw TSX code without explanations or markdown.

--> 2nd user prompt:
Create an intuitive React component that teaches {title} to 15 to 18-year-old human students.
CONCEPT BREAKDOWN:
1. Name of the concept: {title}
2. Core Principle: {summary}
3. Claude 3.5 explanation and idea: {claude_response}

EDUCATIONAL GOALS:
1. Help the human student understand {title} by connecting it to familiar concepts
2. Show practical applications they might encounter in daily life
3. Build understanding through progressive revelation, not all at once

VISUALIZATION APPROACH:
1. Animation & Interaction:
 - Start with an automatic demo cycle using useEffect with proper cleanup
 - Implement timing logic using useEffect hook with cleanup functions
 - Allow human user interaction when relevant
 - The interactions might include, but not limited to, moving objects, selecting objects given a criteria, sliding objetcts, Scroll or Pinch-to-zoom, Swipe navigation, Drag and Drop Operations, Scroll-Based Interactions, Interactive tutorials
 - Avoid using just a "next/start/pause/play" button as interaction
 - Provide reset capability
 - Use humor and relatable situations when appropriate
 - Show cause-and-effect clearly
2. Visual Elements:
 - Every visual element should map to a real concept
 - Use Lucide icons as meaningful symbols, not decoration

Remember: A successful visualization is one where users can explain the concept to others after using it.

  💬 Stage 1 response: I'll break this down into an engaging educational approach for teaching Heuristic Search Techniques.

CORE METAPHORS & EXAMPLES:

1. "The Mountain Climber Metaphor"
- Main Concept: A climber looking for the summit in foggy conditions
- Elements:
  * The climber can only see their immediate surroundings (limited information)
  * They use basic rules: "keep going up" and "follow the steepest path"
  * Sometimes they might need to go down slightly to reach a better path up
  * Maps to concepts of local vs. global optima, informed decision-making
  
2. "The Library Detective Metaphor"
- Main Concept: Finding a specific book without checking every single book
- Elements:
  * Using the Dewey Decimal System (informed strategy)
  * Following signs and categories (heuristic rules)
  * Making educated guesses about location
  * Maps to concept of reducing search space using available information

PROPOSED REACT COMPONENT: "HeuristicMountaineer"

An interactive visualization where students:
1. Control a virtual climber on a 3D mountain
2. Can only see a limited radius around their position
3. Must choose different heuristic rules to reach the summit:
   - "Always go up" (basic heuristic)
   - "Follow the path" (infrastructure heuristic)
   - "Ask other climbers" (social heuristic)
   - "Use compass and map" (informed heuristic)

Features:
- Multiple mountains with different optimal strategies
- Fog of war to simulate limited information
- Performance metrics (time, energy, distance)
- Visual comparison of different heuristic approaches
- Split screen showing both local and global view

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:

Students should be able to:
1. Explain why heuristics are useful (efficiency vs. completeness)
2. Identify situations where heuristics are appropriate
3. Compare different heuristic approaches
4. Understand limitations and trade-offs

MISCONCEPTION PREVENTION:
- Emphasize that heuristics don't guarantee optimal solutions
- Show cases where heuristics fail
- Demonstrate why pure random search or complete search might be worse

VERIFICATION OF UNDERSTANDING:
1. Ask students to create their own heuristic rules for new scenarios
2. Have them predict outcomes of different heuristic approaches
3. Challenge them to identify real-world examples of heuristic decision-making

EXTENSIONS:
- Compare multiple climbers using different strategies simultaneously
- Add weather conditions affecting heuristic effectiveness
- Include collaborative heuristic strategies
- Show historical paths of previous attempts

This approach combines visual, interactive, and metaphorical learning while maintaining technical accuracy and preventing common misconceptions about heuristic search techniques.

    Total tokens: 898

  💬 Stage 1 response: I'll break this down into engaging metaphors and then propose an interactive React component concept.

METAPHORS & REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES:

1. "The Library Catalog System" Metaphor
- Instead of searching through every book, libraries organize books by sections (Fiction, Science, History)
- Within each section, books are further organized by sub-categories
- This mirrors how PQ breaks down high-dimensional vectors into manageable sub-vectors
- Just like finding a book using section + subsection is faster than checking every book

2. "Pizza Customization Menu" Metaphor
- A pizza with many toppings can be represented as a complex vector
- Instead of storing every possible pizza combination (expensive)
- Restaurants pre-define common base combinations and modifications
- Customers select from these "quantized" options rather than infinite possibilities
- Maps perfectly to how PQ creates codebooks of common patterns

3. "Color Palette Compression" Metaphor
- Instead of storing exact RGB values for millions of colors
- We group similar colors into representative swatches
- Different parts of the image use different color palettes
- Like how PQ creates different codebooks for different vector dimensions

REACT COMPONENT CONCEPT: "The PQ Color Creator"

Interactive visualization where students:
1. Start with a high-resolution image
2. Divide the image into sections (sub-vectors)
3. Apply different levels of color quantization to each section
4. See how PQ balances compression vs. accuracy

- Slider to control number of sections
- Slider for quantization levels per section
- Real-time visualization of:
  * Original data size vs. compressed size
  * Quality loss visualization
  * Reconstruction process

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
Students should understand:
- Why breaking vectors into sub-vectors is beneficial
- How codebooks work as lookup tables
- The trade-off between compression and accuracy
- When to use PQ vs. other techniques

VERIFICATION OF UNDERSTANDING:
1. Ask students to explain PQ using their own metaphor
2. Have them predict compression results
3. Challenge them to identify real-world applications

POTENTIAL MISCONCEPTIONS TO ADDRESS:
- PQ is not just simple clustering
- Sub-vectors are not independent
- Quantization is not random sampling

This approach makes the abstract concept of PQ tangible through familiar examples while the interactive component allows hands-on experimentation with the core principles.
