Self-awareness in AI is an advanced and largely theoretical concept that would entail an AI system possessing a form of consciousness, enabling it to recognize its own actions, existence, and perhaps even emotional states. This level of awareness goes beyond mere data processing and decision-making to include introspective abilities, allowing the AI to evaluate its own performance, set goals, and understand its role within a larger system. Self-aware AI would mark a significant leap in artificial intelligence, integrating elements of psychology, cognitive science, and philosophy. Current AI systems do not possess true self-awareness; they operate based on pre-programmed instructions and learning from data without any intrinsic understanding of their own processes.

The notion of self-awareness in AI traces back to early speculative science fiction and philosophical discussions about machine consciousness. The idea began gaining traction in academic circles in the 1990s and early 2000s with advancements in cognitive science and AI research, though it remains largely theoretical today.

Key figures in the discussion of AI self-awareness include Alan Turing, whose early work on machine intelligence laid foundational questions about machine consciousness, and more recently, researchers like David Chalmers and Giulio Tononi, who have contributed to the understanding of consciousness and its potential applications in AI.
