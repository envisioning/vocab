summary: Process of carefully designing input prompts to elicit desired outputs from language models.
title: Prompt Engineering
---

Prompt engineering involves the strategic crafting of input text (prompts) to guide AI models, especially generative ones like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), towards producing specific types of responses or content. This practice is crucial in applications ranging from content generation to information extraction, where the quality and relevance of the model's output can significantly impact the utility of the AI application. Effective prompt engineering can dramatically enhance a model's performance, requiring an understanding of the model's training data, architecture, and capabilities. It blends elements of psychology, linguistics, and data science to optimize interactions with AI systems.

Although the concept of tailoring inputs to influence outputs in computational systems is not new, the term "prompt engineering" specifically gained traction alongside the rise of advanced language models like OpenAI's GPT series, particularly around 2020. As these models became more sophisticated and widely accessible, the technique of designing prompts to achieve better results from AI became an area of interest both for research and practical applications.

The development of prompt engineering as a recognized practice does not have a single originator but has evolved through the contributions of countless researchers, developers, and practitioners working with advanced language models. Organizations like OpenAI, Google Brain, and others involved in the development and refinement of large language models have played significant roles in advancing the understanding and application of prompt engineering techniques.
