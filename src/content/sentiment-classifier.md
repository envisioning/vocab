title: Sentiment Classifier
---

A Sentiment Classifier is an integral component in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is used to determine and categorize the emotions or opinions expressed in a piece of text, such as user reviews or social media posts. This form of text analysis assesses whether the expressed opinion in the text is positive, negative, or neutral and is particularly useful in cases where businesses want to understand customers' perceptions or feelings towards their products or services. Complex sentiment classifiers may also identify emotions beyond the basic categorizations, like anger, joy, or surprise.

Historical overview: The emergence of sentiment classifiers comes from the broader field of sentiment analysis which arose along with the Machine Learning (ML) revolution in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The popularization of social media and user-generated content in the mid-2000s further increased the demand for tools that could analyze public opinion at large scales, hence boosting the significance of sentiment classifiers.

Key contributors: The development of sentiment classifiers is a combined effort of many researchers and scientists in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. Significant contributors include Bo Pang and Lillian Lee, who published one of the first academic papers on the topic, "Thumbs up? Sentiment Classification using Machine Learning Techniques," in 2002.
