title: Model Garden
---

Model gardens serve as a valuable resource for AI practitioners by providing a variety of models that are pre-trained on extensive datasets, covering numerous domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics. This approach reduces the need for users to train models from scratch, saving significant resources and time. Model gardens often include models that are state-of-the-art, continuously updated to incorporate the latest research findings and methodologies. They also provide tools and frameworks to facilitate model adaptation and deployment, enhancing the practical utility of these models in real-world applications.

The concept of model gardens gained traction around the mid-2010s as companies like Google and Microsoft began to open-source their machine learning models. This trend coincided with the rise of deep learning and the broader adoption of machine learning across various industries, necessitating more efficient ways to share, improve, and deploy AI models.

Major tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook have been instrumental in popularizing the concept of model gardens. Google's TensorFlow Hub and Microsoft's Azure AI Gallery are prominent examples of model gardens that aggregate various machine learning models, providing platforms for their dissemination and collaborative enhancement.
