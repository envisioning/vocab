Naive semantics in AI offers a simplistic framework for interpreting logical expressions, typically relying on a direct correspondence with natural language understanding. It simplifies the complexity found in more intricate semantic models by focusing on intuitive mappings and interpretations, enabling swift initial development of AI systems but sometimes sacrificing depth and nuance in understanding. This approach is often seen in early stages of semantic parsing when the objective is rapid prototyping, and it sometimes acts as a foundational layer upon which more sophisticated semantic analyses are built. Naive semantics acts as a baseline against which more advanced and computationally expensive semantic models, like Montague semantics or distributional semantic models, can be compared, thereby aiding in the progressive refinement of AI systems as they evolve in complexity and capability.

The exact inception of naive semantics in the context of AI is nebulous, but it gained attention as early systems required intuitive models of meaning. It started gaining traction in the 1970s when initial efforts in natural language processing highlighted the need for simple semantic frameworks to bridge language and logic.

Key contributors in developing naive semantics are less singularly identifiable compared to more formal semantic theories; however, much of its evolution is intertwined with the broader progress in AI and computational linguistics. Researchers focusing on early natural language understanding tasks, such as Roger Schank with conceptual dependency theory, have indirectly influenced the development and application of naive semantic approaches.
