Planetary scale systems in the context of AI involve enormous computational frameworks that harness global data and resources to address complex issues such as climate change, global health, and economic modeling. These systems utilize advanced AI capabilities to process and analyze massive volumes of data in real-time, providing insights that can influence policy-making, scientific research, or logistic operations on a worldwide scale. They are built on distributed networks of data centers, leveraging cloud technologies and parallel processing to achieve the necessary scale and speed of computation. The significance of these systems lies in their ability to synthesize diverse data sources and deploy sophisticated predictive models, enabling a new level of understanding and responsiveness to planetary-level phenomena.

The idea of planetary scale systems gained traction in the late 2000s, coinciding with significant advancements in cloud computing and global connectivity that enabled widespread data sharing and computation on unprecedented scales. The concept began gaining widespread attention around the early 2010s as the capacity to collect and process global datasets rapidly expanded.

Key contributors to the conceptual and technological development of planetary scale systems include major tech companies like Google and Microsoft, as well as collaborations involving academic institutions and government agencies. These entities developed foundational technologies in cloud computing, big data, and distributed AI frameworks that underpin these systems.
