Forward chaining is a data-driven reasoning technique commonly used in AI for expert systems and automated reasoning. It starts with a set of known facts and applies inference rules to extract more data until it arrives at a desired conclusion or goal. This approach fits well in environments where the rules are dynamic and the set of possible conclusions is not fully predetermined, such as in real-time systems or environments with evolving data. By utilizing forward chaining, AI systems can efficiently process large datasets by focusing computations on scenarios that are actively supported by the available evidence.

The concept of forward chaining emerged prominently in the 1970s as AI researchers sought to improve rule-based systems' efficiency in processing knowledge. The technique has continually evolved, achieving greater prominence in the 1980s with the development of more sophisticated expert systems and real-time processing technologies.

Key contributors to the development of forward chaining include Bruce Buchanan and Edward Shortliffe, whose work on rule-based expert systems like MYCIN demonstrated the power of inference engines that utilized both forward and backward chaining for medical diagnoses. Their contributions laid the groundwork for modern expert systems and decision-making frameworks in AI.
