Visual chain of thought refers to techniques in ML (Machine Learning) and AI that produce a sequence of grounded visual intermediates—such as attention maps, sketches, stepwise image edits, scene graphs, or program-like visual traces—that expose the model’s internal reasoning as it solves a complex visual task; these intermediates can be generated autoregressively or extracted from latent states and are used both as explanations for decisions and as targets for supervising or constraining multi-step reasoning. The approach adapts the chain-of-thought concept from language models to multimodal domains, emphasizing compositionality and explicit intermediate structure to bridge perception and symbolic manipulation: models learn to decompose a problem into verifiable substeps (e.g., localize objects, infer relations, transform or plan actions) and to either self-correct via backtracking or aggregate multiple chains (self-consistency) to improve final answers. Practically, visual chains of thought have been implemented via transformer attention visualizations, neural module networks that emit intermediate program states, diffusion or iterative-image-editing pipelines that render stepwise transformations, and latent-token sequences representing scene graphs; they are valuable in tasks requiring compositional reasoning or planning such as visual question answering, robotic manipulation and planning, procedural image editing, and interpretable multimodal decision-making. Key theoretical challenges include ensuring faithfulness (that the chain reflects true causal computation rather than post hoc justification), scaling stepwise supervision without prohibitive annotation cost, and integrating continuous visual latents with discrete symbolic traces for robust generalization.

First appeared in the literature around 2022–2023 as researchers extended chain-of-thought ideas from language to vision; the concept gained wider traction and visibility in 2023–2024 with the rise of large multimodal models and targeted papers demonstrating stepwise visual reasoning and multimodal prompting techniques.

Key contributors include the teams that introduced chain-of-thought prompting for reasoning in language models (e.g., Jason Wei et al., 2022) whose ideas motivated visual extensions; research groups working on multimodal foundation models and interpretable reasoning at Google Research / DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic; and earlier foundational work on compositional visual reasoning and modular architectures (e.g., neural module networks by Jacob Andreas and colleagues, and the CLEVR benchmark by Justin Johnson et al.) plus communities developing VQA (visual question answering) and structured scene representations that enabled practical implementations and evaluation of visual chain-of-thought methods.
