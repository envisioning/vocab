Autoregressive prediction is a core concept in time series analysis and statistical modeling, enabling predictions of future data points by regressing them on their preceding values in a sequential dataset. It holds paramount significance in AI for applications where historical data can inform future outputs, such as in language models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), speech recognition, and financial forecasting. Autoregressive models, including AR (autoregressive), ARMA (autoregressive moving average), and ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average), estimate and update probability distributions over potential outcomes iteratively, thus capturing temporal dependencies effectively. In AI, autoregressive predictions are crucial for generating coherent sequences, allowing models to build narratives, synthesize audio, or predict stock prices by consistently referring back to prior outputs as inputs.

The concept of autoregressive models can be traced back to early 20th-century developments in statistics, specifically around the 1920s, with Theodore Yule's work on autoregressive moving averages. However, it gained significant traction and formal recognition in AI with the development of sequential models like HMMs (Hidden Markov Models) and later with neural networks in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

Key contributors to the development of autoregressive models in AI include figures like Andrey Markov, who laid the foundation with Markov chains, and more contemporarily, researchers like Alex Graves, who advanced autoregressive models within deep learning frameworks, especially in sequence prediction and language generation tasks.
