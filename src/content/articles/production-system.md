In AI, a production system operates as a rule-based architecture that utilizes a sequence of condition-action pairs (production rules) to manipulate and derive solutions from a database of facts (working memory). The system's primary components include a rule base, a working memory, and a control mechanism, which are crucial for executing actions based on matching conditions, facilitating both logical reasoning and heuristic problem-solving. Such systems are deployed in expert systems and automated planning, playing a significant role in modeling human cognitive processes and enabling applications like natural language processing and decision support systems to function effectively by systematically applying rules until a goal state is achieved.

Production systems have roots dating back to early AI research, with formal introductions around the late 1960s and gaining traction in the 1970s as research in cognitive simulation and expert systems expanded, illustrating their foundational significance in AI's evolution.

Key contributors to the development of production systems include Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon, whose work on human cognitive modeling and heuristics laid the groundwork, and Edward Feigenbaum, who further advanced their application in expert systems.
