Batch size is a crucial hyperparameter in AI and ML that impacts computational efficiency and model performance during the training of neural networks. It defines the number of samples that pass through the model before an update to the model's weights is made. Small batch sizes might lead to noisy gradient estimates but can provide better generalization, while larger batches might converge more quickly but require more memory. Moreover, the choice of batch size interacts with other parameters, like learning rate, and can affect the stability, convergence rate, and generalization of the model. Therefore, selecting an optimal batch size is essential for balancing the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost, especially in large-scale datasets where resources may be limited.

The concept of batch processing in the realm of AI gained prominence with the advent of backpropagation in the 1980s, although the use of batch processing in computational tasks dates back to earlier developments in computer science.

While the term "batch size" is widely used in the AI community, its development as a critical aspect of neural network training doesn't attribute to any singular personality. Nonetheless, it has been widely explored and discussed in works by scholars contributing to the advancement of deep learning, including prominent figures such as Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio. Their combined work on neural networks and backpropagation has implicitly solidified the importance of hyperparameters like batch size in training complex models.
