summary: Persistent storage and retrieval of generated data and learned behaviors to maintain a model's performance and ensure its utility over time.
title: Persistency
---

Persistency has particular importance in AI when it comes to managing large data sets, model retraining and achieving balance between system resources and overall performance. AI applications often generate vast amounts of data. To use this data effectively for improved future performance and decision-making, such information must be stored persistently and accessed when needed. This not only establishes a consistent basis for machine learning but also ensures the longevity of the learned behaviors and responses. Essentially, persistency in AI is more about maintaining a continuous learning and evolving trajectory rather than starting from scratch each time.

Historically, persistency as a concept in computer science and AI has been present ever since the inception of database systems in the 1960s. However, with the advent of AI and deep learning technologies in the latter part of the 20th and early 21st century, persistency has gained renewed significance to help maintain learning continuity in AI models.

Key contributors to this field include those involved in the development of storage and database systems that have allowed elaborate and persistent data management. These contributors range from academic researchers who have proposed new theories and techniques, to tech corporations that have implemented practical systems enabling greater persistency in AI applications.
