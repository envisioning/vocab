In AI, a class is a distinct category or group used to label and organize data points in classification problems, which is a subset of supervised learning where the aim is to predict discrete labels. Classes are crucial in algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks, which aim to assign input data to one or more categories based on their features. The efficiency and accuracy of classification significantly depend on the proper definition and delineation of these classes, affecting tasks ranging from simple binary classifications like spam detection to complex multi-class classifications seen in image recognition. Practical uses of classes span various domains, such as healthcare for disease categorization, finance for credit risk assessment, and autonomous vehicles for object recognition, showcasing their integral role in supervised ML tasks.

The concept of using classes in machine learning became more formally recognized as the field advanced, particularly during the 1980s when classification problems began gaining prominence with the introduction of decision trees and other supervised learning methods. The term gained popularity as AI and ML evolved, especially with the advent of more sophisticated classification models in the 1990s and 2000s.

Significant contributors to the concept of classes in AI include researchers like Ross Quinlan, known for developing the ID3 algorithm used for constructing decision trees, and the broader ML community, which has explored various classification frameworks to enhance capability and accuracy in intelligent systems.
