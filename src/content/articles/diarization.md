Diarization is a crucial AI process that involves partitioning audio streams into homogeneous segments according to speaker identity, also known as speaker diarization. This task is significant in various AI applications, particularly in automated transcription and meeting analysis where it enhances the understanding of dialogues by distinguishing between different speakers. It employs advanced techniques such as clustering and deep learning models to effectively label segments associated with different speakers without prior knowledge of their identities. In complex multi-speaker scenarios, diarization becomes essential for disentangling overlapping speech and improving the accuracy of speech recognition systems. Furthermore, diarization plays a pivotal role in developing intelligent voice assistants and surveillance systems, thus facilitating innovations in building human-computer interaction frameworks and multimedia retrieval systems.

The term and initial technologies for diarization emerged in the 1990s, primarily related to speech recognition research. It gained more popularity in the early 2000s as the demand increased for accurate processing of multimedia content, largely driven by progress in ML and AI.

Key contributors to the development of diarization include researchers in the speech processing community, such as Douglas Reynolds and the team at SRI International, with significant advancements coming from collaborations involving academic institutions, research labs, and conferences like the Speaker Odyssey Workshops.
