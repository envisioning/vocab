In AI, a timestep is a critical component within iterative processes such as reinforcement learning or time-series models, representing a discrete time interval over which computations or updates occur. In reinforcement learning, timesteps are used to define the sequence of states, actions, and rewards, facilitating the update of value functions that guide agent learning. They serve as a basic unit of measurement in simulations, allowing chronological progression and thereby enabling the modeling of dynamic systems. Within time-series predictions, timesteps demarcate the temporal granularity of data inputs, crucially affecting algorithm performance and accuracy. Each timestep marks a point where an algorithm updates its parameters, reads data, or issues an action.

The concept of using timesteps is rooted in the broader context of simulations and computational modeling, with early computational models in the 1950s and 1960s adopting discrete time intervals for processing sequential information. However, timesteps gained particular prominence in AI in the late 1990s alongside the rise of practical reinforcement learning applications.

Significant contributors to the development and popularization of the term "timestep" in AI include researchers like Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto, who played pivotal roles in advancing reinforcement learning frameworks, where the concept of a timestep is integrally utilized. They, among others, have driven much of the foundational research integrating timesteps into the core methodologies of modern AI systems.
