The MCP (McCulloch-Pitts) neuron is a simplified model of a biological neuron that was established in 1943 by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts. This model is considered foundational in the field of AI as it laid the groundwork for the development of artificial neural networks. The MCP neuron operates by receiving multiple binary inputs, processing them through a set of weights, and then producing an output based on a threshold function. Its significance lies in its abstraction of neural function, which allows it to act as a basic unit for constructing complex machine learning architectures capable of performing a wide range of tasks from pattern recognition to decision making. While simplistic, the MCP neuron captures the essential concept of weighted input aggregation and activation, which continues to underpin neural network research and application today.

Introduced in 1943, the MCP neuron gained traction in the mid-20th century as interest in AI research burgeoned, particularly during the 1950s and 1960s when neural network models started to be refined and widely applied. 

Key contributors to the development of the MCP neuron model were Warren McCulloch, a neurophysiologist, and Walter Pitts, a logician, whose collaborative work provided a new computational perspective on understanding how networks of neurons could realize logical operations and computation. Their pioneering ideas have influenced generations of researchers in AI and computational neuroscience.
