title: Context Rot
summary: Gradual degradation of the effective context used by an AI system—internal state, prompt history, or external knowledge—resulting in stale, contradictory, or less relevant outputs over time.

Context rot describes how an AI system’s usable context (conversation history, cached state, retrieved documents, embeddings, or other situational inputs) progressively loses relevance or fidelity, producing responses that are stale, inconsistent, or misaligned with current facts or user intent.

In expert terms, context rot arises from the intersection of limited context capacity, temporal drift in external knowledge sources, representation decay in cached embeddings or memories, and operational policies that evict or truncate context (e.g., fixed token windows, sliding caches, or LRU indexing). It is tightly related to well-studied phenomena such as catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, concept drift in ML (Machine Learning) production pipelines, and information-theoretic limits of attention-based models. In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-lived conversational agents, context rot can appear as outdated retrievals (stale documents or reindexed embeddings), diverging internal state after many turns (context fragmentation), or loss of personalization when session state is truncated or not refreshed. Practically, it increases hallucination rates, causes contradiction across turns, degrades grounding and provenance, and erodes user trust. Mitigations combine system design and learning strategies: time-aware retrieval and timestamping, periodic reindexing or re-embedding, hierarchical and compressed representations of long histories, memory-refresh or rehearsal techniques, continual fine-tuning with anchored prompts, explicit provenance and freshness signals, and architectural approaches that separate short-term attention from long-term memory. Measuring context rot requires longitudinal evaluation—drift metrics for embeddings, freshness and relevance scores for retrieved contexts, and controlled multi-turn consistency tests.

First noted informally in developer forums and system-ops discussions around 2021–2022, the term gained broad popularity in 2023–2024 as large language models and RAG deployments exposed practical failures from stale context and long-lived sessions.

Key contributors to the concept are primarily communities and research lines rather than a single originator: work on memory-augmented neural networks (e.g., Memory Networks by Weston et al.), retrieval-centered methods such as REALM (Guu et al.) and RAG (Patrick Lewis et al.), foundational Transformer and attention research (Vaswani et al.) that created long-context models, and continual learning/catastrophic forgetting research (e.g., Kirkpatrick et al.). In practice, engineering teams at major labs and providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind and many production ML (Machine Learning) teams) have driven the term’s adoption through operational experience and tooling to address context degradation.
