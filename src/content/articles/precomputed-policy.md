Precomputed Policy refers to the predetermined strategy derived for decision-making systems, especially within the realm of reinforcement learning. In this context, policies define the behavior of an agent, specifying the action to be taken in each state to maximize cumulative rewards. By precomputing a policy, the system leverages offline computations, often using methods like dynamic programming or Monte Carlo simulations, to evaluate and optimize actions before real-time deployment. This approach is crucial in scenarios where immediate, computationally expensive decision-making is required, and latency must be minimized. Utilization of precomputed policies enables complex AI systems to function efficiently by having a ready-to-use action plan that requires minimal further computation during execution.

The concept of using precomputed strategies in decision-making can be traced back to the foundational work on dynamic programming by Richard Bellman in the 1950s. It gained popularity as reinforcement learning matured in the late 1990s, particularly with works on algorithms that could effectively precompute optimal policies for various applications, culminating in significant advancements by the 2010s with the introduction of sophisticated models and techniques in AI.

Researchers like Richard Bellman have played a pivotal role in laying the groundwork for precomputed policies, especially with his formal introduction of dynamic programming. Subsequent significant contributions were made by others in the AI community, including Andrew Barto and Richard Sutton, who advanced reinforcement learning methodologies that often employ such strategic policy generation.
