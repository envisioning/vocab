summary:
  A meme in AI discourse highlighting the potential uncontrollable, alien nature
  of advanced AI systems, often embodying concerns about opaque decision processes
  and unanticipated outcomes.

year_origin: 2010
---

The term 'Shoggoth' in AI discourse metaphorically reflects concerns about highly advanced and opaque AI systems whose internal workings are vastly complex and potentially unknowable, akin to the monstrous entities in H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. These systems, while immensely powerful, are still fundamentally bound by the limitations and unexpected behaviors stemming from imperfectly understood ML algorithms. The application of this metaphor highlights discussions around AI safety, transparency, and the ethical implications of deploying systems with decisions that might seem alien to human operators. The allure and terror encapsulated in the 'Shoggoth' symbolism derive from AI's capability to produce unexpected emergent behaviors once certain complexity thresholds are crossed, necessitating meticulous scrutiny over both designed algorithms and their training data.

The term 'Shoggoth' first surfaced in the context of AI discourse around the late 2010s, with its usage gaining popularity as AI safety and ethics became more pressing issues in academic and public spheres. It was primarily popularized through meme culture and online discussions among AI researchers and enthusiasts seeking to encapsulate the uncanny complexity of black-box AI systems.

While no specific individual is credited with introducing the term 'Shoggoth' to AI lexicon, its adoption in AI discussions can be traced to online forums and social media interactions among AI researchers, enthusiasts, and ethicists, mirroring broader cultural conversations about the powers and perils of AI systems.
