State representation in AI is crucial for determining how agents perceive their environment, significantly impacting their decision-making and learning capabilities. Essentially, it involves selecting, organizing, and structuring relevant information from the environment into a format that can be effectively processed by algorithms. In domains such as reinforcement learning, state representation affects the agent's ability to generalize past experiences to new situations, influencing both the efficiency and the success of learning. Poor state representations can lead to inefficient learning processes and suboptimal policies, while good representations can significantly improve the convergence speed and performance of an AI system. The quest for optimal state representations intertwines with various disciplines, including neuroscience, robotics, and cognitive science and plays a critical role in developing more advanced AI systems capable of operating in complex, real-world environments.  

The idea of state representation emerged alongside the development of early AI systems in the mid-20th century, but it gained significant attention and refined development in the context of reinforcement learning and neural networks in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  

Key contributors to the development of state representation concepts include Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto, who significantly advanced the field of reinforcement learning, shaping how state representation is considered within this context. Their work laid foundational principles that continue to influence research in state representation and its applications in AI.
