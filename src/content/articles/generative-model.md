Generative models represent a class of AI models crucial for tasks involving the creation of new data samples, capturing the underlying distribution of a given dataset. These models are characterized by their ability to learn joint probability distributions, as opposed to discriminative models which focus on conditional probabilities. They play an important role in a variety of applications, including data augmentation, drug discovery, image synthesis, and unsupervised learning tasks. Notable sub-types like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) illustrate their versatility by effectively generating high-quality images, realistic text sequences, and complex scenes, thereby pushing the boundaries of creative AI tasks while highlighting the challenges of balancing model complexity and computational efficiency.

The concept of generative models can be traced back to statistical methods in the early 20th century but gained significant traction in AI around the 1980s with the advent of probabilistic graphical models. The emergence of GANs in 2014 and VAEs in 2013 marked pivotal moments, significantly boosting their popularity and application breadth in AI research and industry.

Ian Goodfellow is a key figure in the development of generative models, especially recognized for proposing GANs. Other contributors like Diederik P. Kingma for VAEs, and Geoffrey Hinton, who has advanced probabilistic models, have considerably influenced the evolution and application of generative models in AI.
