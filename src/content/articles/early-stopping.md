In the context of AI and ML, early stopping is a crucial strategy employed to improve model generalization by terminating training when the model's performance on a held-out validation dataset begins to decrease, indicating potential overfitting on the training data. This method serves as a form of regularization, ensuring that the model does not memorize the training inputs but instead learns to generalize to unseen data. Early stopping is particularly significant in iterative learning algorithms like those used for training deep neural networks, where it helps avoid unnecessary computation and resources while achieving a model that generalizes well. The approach involves monitoring the model's performance indicators—such as loss or accuracy—on a validation set and halting training once these indicators start to worsen, suggesting the model is starting to overfit to the training data rather than truly improving.

Early stopping as a concept can be traced back to the late 20th century, with its principles discussed in academic literature around the 1990s and gaining widespread popularity in the 2010s as deep learning techniques emerged as mainstream methods in AI.

The development of early stopping as a practical technique within ML has been enriched by contributions from numerous researchers aiming to optimize neural networks, with key early contribuor figures including Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, whose work on neural network optimization touched upon strategies to mitigate overfitting, setting foundational elements leading to methods like early stopping.
