Probes are instrumental in the field of AI for examining the inner workings of complex models, such as neural networks, to gain insights into the representation and processing of information within these systems. Probing techniques typically involve training additional, simpler models (probes) on top of the internal representations of a target model to ascertain whether certain information, like syntactic or semantic properties, is encoded at particular layers. This method can help demystify otherwise opaque machine learning architectures by providing a clearer picture of what specific hidden units or layers are capturing in the data transformation process, thus contributing to fields like interpretability and model diagnostics. The significance of probes extends to understanding failures in AI models, evaluating transfer learning potential, and enhancing trust and transparency by verifying that models are correctly leveraging their learned data distribution.

The concept of probing as an analytical approach started gaining attention in the AI community around the mid-2010s. Its popularity surged with the increasing complexity of neural networks, especially after the rise of deep learning models, which required methods to better understand their layered structures and behavior.

Key contributors to the development of probing tools and techniques include researchers like Jason Yosinski, who contributed to understanding transfer learning and visualization, and efforts from AI research teams focused on model interpretability, such as those at OpenAI and Google Brain. Their work collectively advanced the tools and techniques for probing neural networks, improving the clarity and interpretability of AI systems.
