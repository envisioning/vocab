In theoretical computer science and AI, Kolmogorov complexity gauges the length of the shortest possible program, in a fixed universal language, that generates a given string as output. This concept is critical in understanding the amount of information and underlying regularities in data, implying that data with lower complexity can be highly compressed, whereas data with higher complexity, often considered more random, requires longer descriptions. Within AI, Kolmogorov complexity provides insights into data compression, pattern recognition, and even the fundamental limits of algorithmic learning and inference, as it highlights the relationship between data description and computational efficiency.

Kolmogorov complexity was first proposed in 1965 and gradually gained attention in the 1970s as computer scientists and theorists explored its implications for information theory and algorithmic randomness. 

The concept was chiefly developed by Andrey Kolmogorov, a pioneering Russian mathematician, who contributed extensively to probability theory and introduced the formal definition of this complexity. His work laid the groundwork for further developments by others like Gregory Chaitin and Ray Solomonoff, who helped expand the application of these ideas in the context of AI and algorithmic information theory.
