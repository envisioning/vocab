Shor's Algorithm is a revolutionary quantum algorithm developed by Peter Shor in 1994, primarily for integer factorization, which underpins the security of widely used encryption schemes like RSA. The algorithm takes advantage of quantum computers' ability to run multiple calculations simultaneously via quantum parallelism, offering an exponential speedup over the best-known classical factoring algorithms, such as the quadratic sieve and the general number field sieve. This breakthrough highlights the potential of quantum computing to disrupt fields reliant on the hardness of problems, specifically cryptography, prompting significant research into quantum-resistant encryption protocols and broader discussions about post-quantum cryptography. Shor's Algorithm is often cited as a landmark result in the field of quantum computing, drawing attention to both the power and consequences of advancements in computational theories and technologies.

Introduced in 1994, Shor's Algorithm gained significant attention in the late 1990s as the feasibility of large-scale quantum computing became a subject of intensive research and speculation.

Peter Shor, then a researcher at Bell Labs, is the key contributor to the development of Shor's Algorithm. His work sparked a new era of research in both quantum computing and cryptographic security, establishing foundations that many subsequent researchers in quantum algorithms and cryptography have expanded upon.
