Answer Set Programming is a form of declarative programming oriented towards difficult combinatorial search problems, leveraging stable model semantics to enable efficient problem-solving by modeling constraints and rules using logic statements, resulting in one or more "answer sets" that represent solutions. ASP allows experts to focus on specifying the problem in logical terms, leaving the search for solutions to highly optimized ASP solvers, making it particularly valuable in fields like artificial intelligence, planning, and knowledge representation. Originating in the late 1980s, ASP gained popularity in the 1990s as researchers recognized its power and efficiency in non-monotonic reasoning tasks. Key contributors to ASP development include Michael Gelfond and Vladimir Lifschitz, whose pioneering work in the late 1980s laid the groundwork for its theoretical foundations and practical implementations.
