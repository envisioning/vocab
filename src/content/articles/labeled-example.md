In the context of AI, a labeled example is a data sample paired with its corresponding label, which indicates the desired output or classification, serving as the foundation for training supervised ML algorithms. Labeled examples are essential in supervised learning as they allow models to understand the mapping from input to output, enabling the system to predict labels for new, unseen data. During the training process, the model adjusts its parameters to minimize the prediction error on these examples, improving its generalization ability. High-quality labeled data is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and robustness of ML models, often resulting in large-scale data annotation efforts, which can be costly and time-consuming. These examples form datasets that often need to be extensive and diverse to capture the variability in the real world effectively, influencing the success and performance of models trained on them.

The concept of labeled examples gained prominence in the mid-1990s with the rise of supervised learning techniques, as data-driven approaches began overtaking rule-based systems in AI.

Key contributors to the development and emphasis on labeled examples include pioneers in supervised learning like Vladimir Vapnik, who co-developed the Support Vector Machine, and Geoffrey Hinton, who significantly advanced the use of neural networks in supervised contexts.
