RSP (Responsible Scaling Policy) is crucial for the sustainable advancement of AI technologies, mandating that as AI systems grow in scale and capability, they do so in a manner that considers their ethical, environmental, and societal impacts. This policy framework provides guidelines and best practices for the deployment and expansion of AI systems, encouraging organizations to balance innovation with responsibility. It emphasizes accountability in algorithmic design, data usage, and deployment, ensuring that scale-up processes do not compromise ethical standards or lead to unintended societal consequences. By fostering a collaborative approach to AI scaling, RSP aims to align technological progress with human values, minimizing risks and maximizing benefits.

The term "Responsible Scaling Policy" first emerged in scholarly discourse in the mid-2010s, gaining traction around 2019 as AI began to be deployed at increasingly larger scales. It became particularly popular as the AI community recognized the potent influence of large-scale AI models on both industries and global socio-economic landscapes.

Leading contributors to the evolution of RSP include organizations such as the Partnership on AI, which promotes responsible AI practices, and thought leaders like Timnit Gebru and Joy Buolamwini, who have extensively highlighted the ethical dimensions and societal impacts of AI scalability.
