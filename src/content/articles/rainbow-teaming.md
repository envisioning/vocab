title: Rainbow Teaming
---

The term "rainbow teaming" builds on established concepts like red (offensive) and blue (defensive) teams by adding additional layers such as purple (collaboration between offensive and defensive teams), gold (crisis management), and sometimes white (compliance oversight). This holistic approach ensures that vulnerabilities are tested from multiple angles, and insights from offensive, defensive, and operational experts are integrated into a unified strategy. The goal is to foster continuous improvement in security defenses by leveraging the diverse skills and perspectives of these specialized teams.

The concept of rainbow teaming emerged as organizations recognized the limitations of isolated red and blue team activities, gaining traction in recent years as cybersecurity threats became more sophisticated. Pioneers in cybersecurity consulting, such as WithSecure, have been instrumental in formalizing and promoting this method.

By continuously involving various teams in iterative cycles of testing, defense, and response, rainbow teaming provides organizations with a more robust and adaptive security framework, improving resilience to both known and emerging threats.
