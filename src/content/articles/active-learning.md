Active Learning in ML is a paradigm that seeks to enhance model performance by selectively querying the most informative samples from a pool of unlabeled data, thereby reducing the labeling costs and improving model accuracy. This approach is significant in scenarios where large amounts of data are available but labeling is expensive or time-consuming, such as in medical image recognition or natural language processing. In Active Learning, methods like uncertainty sampling, query-by-committee, and expected model change are employed to identify data points that will most benefit the model's learning process. This strategy not only optimizes the use of resources but is also crucial in applications requiring rapid model deployment with limited labeled data, ensuring that the ML model is both efficient and effective.

The concept of Active Learning first appeared in the 1980s, gaining traction in the AI community during the late 1990s and early 2000s, as datasets grew larger and the need for efficient data annotation became apparent.

Key contributors to the development of Active Learning include David Cohn, Richard Ladner, and Alexey Chervonenkis, whose pioneering work laid the groundwork for the algorithms and theoretical frameworks that underpin the current understanding and application of Active Learning in AI.
