The Church-Turing Thesis asserts that if a problem can be solved by any computational method, it can be solved by a Turing machine, effectively setting the benchmark for what is computable in the realm of AI. This thesis underpins much of computational theory, including the development and limitations of AI systems, as it provides a framework for understanding which problems are inherently solvable through algorithmic processes and which are not. Despite its theoretical nature and lacking a formal proof, the Church-Turing Thesis offers crucial insight into the capabilities of both artificial and human intelligenceâ€”essentially defining the boundaries between what is achievable through computation and what remains beyond reach. Its implications extend into the design of algorithms and computational models used in AI, influencing fields such as ML, algorithmic complexity, and even cognitive science, shaping our understanding of machine capabilities versus human cognitive processes.

The Church-Turing Thesis emerged in the mid-1930s, specifically in 1936, when both Alonzo Church and Alan Turing independently proposed models for defining computation and algorithms, gaining traction in academic circles as computers became more pervasive in the mid-20th century.

Key contributors to the Church-Turing Thesis are Alonzo Church, who developed lambda calculus as a formal system for defining computable functions, and Alan Turing, who introduced the concept of the Turing machine as a means of formalizing the process of computation. Both independently arrived at the thesis, which has since united under a common framework, deeply influencing theoretical computer science and AI.
