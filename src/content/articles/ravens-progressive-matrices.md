summary: A non-verbal assessment tool commonly used to measure abstract reasoning,
  which is often regarded as a component of general intelligence.
title: Raven's Progressive Matrices
---

Raven's Progressive Matrices are a standardized test designed to measure an individual's abstract reasoning ability, assuming no linguistic or specific topic knowledge, thereby evaluating the general intelligence quotient in an environment free from cultural biases. This assessment tool is essential in AI research for evaluating and developing models that attempt to mimic human cognitive abilities, such as pattern recognition and visual reasoning. AI systems employing computational models to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices test their capabilities concerning human-level reasoning, offering insights into the development of more advanced and autonomous AI systems.

Ravenâ€™s Progressive Matrices were first introduced in 1938, and they continued to gain prominence in intelligence testing and cognitive psychology fields throughout the 20th century, especially during the era of increased interest in psychometrics and its applications within AI.

The development of Raven's Progressive Matrices was primarily the work of John C. Raven, a British psychologist, who introduced the test as part of his efforts to study and quantify cognitive abilities through a culturally unbiased method.
