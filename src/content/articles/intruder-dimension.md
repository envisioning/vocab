Intruder dimensions are aspects or features within a dataset that can negatively impact the predictive performance or interpretation of AI models by introducing anomalies or noise that diverge substantially from the expected patterns. These unexpected dimensions often surface during the training phase, leading models to overfit or underperform due to their focus on misleading or irrelevant features. Their presence necessitates the need for careful feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques to ensure that AI systems generalize well to new data without being skewed by these deceptive dimensions. The concept is crucial in applications where model accuracy and reliability are paramount, such as in autonomous systems or sensitive data environments, where erroneous predictions could have significant consequences.

The term "intruder dimension" became more prominent in AI literature during the early 2000s as researchers began to explore and address the challenges of high-dimensional data analysis and feature selection, an issue accentuated by ever-growing datasets from diverse sources.

Key contributors to the development and understanding of the concept include researchers involved in statistical learning theory and dimensionality reduction methods, such as Peter Hall and Lawrence Saul, who have significantly advanced techniques for identifying and mitigating the effects of anomalous features in complex datasets.
