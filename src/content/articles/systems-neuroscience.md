Systems neuroscience is pivotal for advancing AI, as it involves the study of how different regions of the brain work together, shedding light on cognitive processes such as perception, decision-making, and motor control that inspire computational models in AI research. By understanding the brain's organizational principles and functional connectivity, AI scientists aim to emulate these biological processes to create more robust and adaptable AI systems. These insights are crucial for developing neural networks and algorithms that mirror human-like learning and adaptability, serving as foundational components in cognitive computing and neuromorphic engineering.

The term "systems neuroscience" originated around the mid-20th century but gained prominence in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as interdisciplinary approaches combining neuroscience, engineering, and computer science became viable, particularly due to advancements in neuroimaging technologies and computational power.

Key contributors to the development and popularization of systems neuroscience include neuroscientists such as Karl Deisseroth, known for pioneering optogenetics, and Olaf Sporns, whose work in brain connectivity has influenced network theory applications in AI.
