Wisdom of the crowd refers to the principle that the aggregated inputs from a diverse group of people can often surpass the accuracy of individual expert judgments, a concept with profound implications in AI systems that rely on large-scale human input data such as crowdsourcing platforms and collaborative filtering algorithms. This principle is applied in AI for tasks like enhancing recommendation systems, improving sentiment analysis, and aggregate forecasting, which all leverage distributed cognitive resources to refine AI model predictions. By integrating crowd wisdom, AI can mitigate biases inherent in isolated data sources and improve robustness and adaptability in dynamic environments, reinforcing the effectiveness of hybrid human-AI computational systems.

The concept traces its origins to Sir Francis Galton's observations in 1907, where he noted the statistical reliability of crowd estimations at a livestock fair, and gained significant attention with James Surowiecki's 2004 book "The Wisdom of Crowds," which popularized the application of this principle in both social science and AI contexts.

Key contributors to the development of wisdom of the crowd include Sir Francis Galton for his pioneering observation of crowd predictions and James Surowiecki, whose work expanded the understanding of its applications across various domains, including AI and decision-making systems.
