title: Capability elucidation
summary: Systematic methods and analyses used to reveal which tasks, behaviors, and latent abilities an AI system possesses, the conditions under which they appear, and the mechanisms or failure modes that enable them.

A detailed, practice-oriented discipline that combines behavioral testing, interpretability, and targeted probing to map an AI system’s actionable skills and their boundaries. In ML (Machine Learning) contexts this involves designing probing tasks and distributional probes, running controlled interventions (ablations, input perturbations, concept erasures), analyzing internal activations and pathways (mechanistic interpretability, causal mediation), and synthesizing results into human-understandable descriptions of capability scope, reliability, and failure modes. Capability elucidation is distinct from raw benchmarking because it emphasizes explanatory links between observed behaviors and model structure or training conditions: it aims to answer not only whether a model can perform X, but how, when, and why that performance emerges or degrades.

Its significance spans safety, alignment, deployment risk assessment, and research into emergent behaviors: by making capabilities explicit and mechanistically grounded, teams can better forecast capability scaling, design mitigations (guardrails, fine-tuning targets, architectural changes), detect unwanted generalization, and prioritize evaluation for high-risk tasks. Applications include auditing for harmful capabilities, discovering hidden tool-use or reasoning routines, constructing capability profiles across model sizes and training regimes, and informing interpretability work that ties specific components to behaviors. Theoretical foundations draw on interpretability and causality (e.g., causal mediation analysis), behavioral testing traditions in ML, and cognitive-science-inspired task decomposition; method choice and validity depend on assumptions about representational alignment and the stability of internal mechanisms under distributional shift.

First surfaced in practice-language and informal reports around 2022–2023 as attention on emergent abilities in large models increased; usage and broader adoption accelerated in 2023–2024 alongside intensive safety and interpretability research that sought to move from descriptive benchmarking to explanatory, mechanism-oriented evaluation.

Key contributors include research groups at OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, and Google Research for work on emergent behavior and large-model evaluation; mechanistic interpretability researchers such as Chris Olah and Neel Nanda for methods that link activations to behavior; authors of emergent-abilities and behavioral-evaluation studies (e.g., Jason Wei and collaborators) for framing and empirical demonstrations; and safety/alignment researchers (many from academic and industry labs) who have driven the practical requirements and standards for capability-focused analyses.
