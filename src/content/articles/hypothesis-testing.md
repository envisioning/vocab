Hypothesis Testing, frequently employed in AI, is a statistical technique used to evaluate and compare datasets. It's a critical process in many AI and machine learning (ML) techniques for determining whether a null hypothesis can be rejected or not, based on available data. In ML, it generally refers to testing a predictive modelâ€™s performance against a null model. It has applications in numerous fields of AI including natural language processing, data analytics, and deep learning.

Historically, the roots of hypothesis testing can be traced back to the early 20th Century with statisticians such as Ronald Fisher, though the technique wasn't widely adopted in AI until much later. Its popularity in AI and ML has exponentially increased with advancements in computational abilities and data sciences.

Key contributors in applying Hypothesis Testing to the field of AI include pioneers in the data sciences and machine learning theorists. While many have contributed to its development and application, it is a fundamental method in statistics that has been built upon by a vast field of researchers within the AI community.
