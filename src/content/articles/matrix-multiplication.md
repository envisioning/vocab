Matrix multiplication, essential for operations in AI and ML, involves taking two matrices and computing a product matrix by summing the product of their respective elements; it forms the backbone of numerous complex computations such as those found in neural networks and various optimization algorithms. In AI, especially, this operation is crucial due to its role in transforming and encoding data, executing transformations during the forward and backward passes of neural networks, and enabling efficient computation of vectorized operations that leverage hardware acceleration through GPUs and TPUs. Its efficiency and capability to scale up computations to the high-dimensional problems is what makes it indispensable in training large AI models.

The operation of matrix multiplication can be traced back to the 19th century but gained widespread recognition and popularity with the advent of digital computing in the mid-20th century, particularly as AI and ML began to mature and required efficient computation on large datasets.

Key figures in the development of matrix multiplication include mathematicians like Arthur Cayley, who contributed significantly to early matrix theory, and later computer scientists who adapted these theories to computer algorithms, such as John von Neumann, whose work laid the groundwork for computer architectures capable of efficient large-scale matrix operations.
