title: Non-Response Bias
summary: A type of bias that occurs in survey data analysis when respondents and non-respondents differ significantly, potentially skewing results and impacting validity.

In AI, non-response bias represents a crucial concern within datasets used for ML models, as it can impede the accuracy and generalizability of predictions. When collecting training data through surveys or feedback systems, if particular groups are overrepresented due to differential response rates, the resulting model will likely echo these imbalances, leading to bias. For instance, if a dataset used to train a customer preference model lacks adequate representation from non-responding demographics, predictions might incorrectly prioritize preferences of more responsive groups. This bias not only threatens model validity but also poses ethical issues, particularly when models influence decision-making in sensitive applications like healthcare or criminal justice. Mitigating non-response bias requires employing techniques like weighting adjustments or imputation methods to ensure diverse representation across subsets of data, thus enhancing model robustness and fairness.

The concept of non-response bias significantly predates AI, originating in early survey research methodologies during the 20th century. It gained focused attention within AI and statistical surveys as these fields grappled with refining outcomes through more representative data collection, a challenge that heightened with the rise of data-intensive approaches in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

Key contributors to understanding and mitigating non-response bias include survey methodologists and statisticians such as Don A. Dillman, who pioneered several modern survey strategies, although AI-specific adaptations have seen substantial contributions from interdisciplinary teams integrating statistics and computer science to tailor solutions for AI datasets.
