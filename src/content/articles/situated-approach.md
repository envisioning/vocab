In the context of AI, the Situated Approach emphasizes that true intelligence arises from the interaction between an agent and its environment, challenging the notion of cognition as solely a computational process detached from physicality. This paradigm suggests that intelligent behavior emerges from situated actions within specific contexts, prioritizing the role of perception and interaction over abstract symbol manipulation. It can deeply influence fields like robotics, where the ability to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and social cues is vital, and AI agents must operate with a sense of presence and awareness that simulates natural intelligence.

The term first appeared in the late 1980s and gained traction in the 1990s as researchers began to question traditional, rule-based AI and explore alternative models that better mimic human-like learning and adaptation processes.

Key contributors include Rodney Brooks and Lucy Suchman, who criticized the classical symbolic paradigm and advocated for a more embodied and interactive form of AI, significantly advancing the theoretical and practical understanding of how intelligence can be grounded in real-world contexts.
