In the context of ML, whitening is a preprocessing step that involves transforming the input data so that each feature has zero mean and unit variance, and the features themselves become uncorrelated. This process is vital for optimizing the performance of neural networks, as it ensures that the data is in an isotropic form, improving the speed at which gradient descent and other optimization algorithms converge. Whitening can be particularly useful in high-dimensional datasets where varying scales and correlations among features can hinder learning processes. A common approach to achieving whitening is through the use of techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or ZCA whitening, where the covariance matrix of the data is normalized to be the identity matrix. This aligns the magnitudes of all feature dimensions, facilitating more efficient learning dynamics.

Whitening as a mathematical concept in statistics can be traced back to the early 20th century but gained popularity in ML contexts with the advent of more complex neural networks in the 1980s. Its significance grew as researchers sought better ways to prepare data to improve convergence rates during network training, marking its surge in utility with the evolution of deep learning methodologies.

Key contributors to the development and popularization of whitening in AI and ML include statisticians and computer scientists who have focused on data preprocessing and neural network optimization, such as Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, who have greatly advanced the understanding and application of such techniques within deep learning frameworks.
