In TensorFlow, a summary provides a powerful mechanism for logging data that can be visualized and analyzed using TensorBoard, which is crucial for debugging and optimizing neural network models. These summaries allow developers to track various metrics like loss and accuracy by logging scalar data or visualizing complex data types such as images and histograms over model iterations. The significance of summaries extends beyond mere visualization; they help in understanding the inner workings of ML models, facilitating hyperparameter tuning, and identifying potential issues in the training process. TensorBoard, as the visualization tool for these summaries, provides a comprehensive suite to monitor the training process, identify bottlenecks, and effectively communicate results, making it an indispensable part of the TensorFlow ecosystem for both research and production environments.

Introduced in 2015 with the release of TensorFlow, summaries became more prominent as TensorBoard's utility in analyzing robust models and large datasets gained traction due to the increasing complexity of deep learning models and the need for detailed insight into training dynamics.

While TensorFlow as a whole was developed by the Google Brain team, Andrew Y. Ng and Jeff Dean are often credited with pioneering efforts that popularized scalable architectures, and the documentation and community contributions played a vital role in shaping the use of summaries with TensorBoard in effective model diagnostics and visualization.
