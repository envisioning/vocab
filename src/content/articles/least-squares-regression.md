Least squares regression is a foundational statistical approach in AI and ML for estimating the relationships among variables. It forms the mathematical backbone for many algorithmic solutions aiming at prediction and data fitting, particularly where the intent is to minimize the discrepancies between observed and predicted data points. This technique is routinely utilized in linear regression models due to its computational simplicity and well-established theoretical properties, providing an optimal solution under the assumption of normally distributed errors with constant variance. Its relevance extends to numerous applications within AI, such as training linear models in supervised learning, fine-tuning weights in neural networks through methods like gradient descent, and even in enhancing algorithms' robustness to noise and variance in data-intensive environments.

The method of least squares was first developed in the late 18th century and gained significant traction in the early 1800s. Its utility was further recognized as computational methods advanced, and its formal mathematical applications became a core component of statistical theory and practice through the 20th century, notably with a broader adoption in AI-related fields as computational power increased.

Key contributions to the development of least squares regression can be attributed to Carl Friedrich Gauss and Adrien-Marie Legendre. Gauss is often credited with providing the theoretical underpinnings and formal mathematical justification for the method, while Legendre was the first to publish the method in 1805. Their combined work laid the groundwork for quantitative analysis methods that are essential in modern AI applications.
