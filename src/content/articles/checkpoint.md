In the context of AI, particularly in ML, a checkpoint refers to a snapshot of a model's parameters and state saved at a specific point during the training process. This is crucial for managing long training sessions, as it allows practitioners to interrupt and resume the training without starting over, safeguarding against data loss from system failures. Checkpoints are also essential for validating different stages of model training and experimenting with various architectures and hyperparameters without committing routine progress. For practical use, checkpoints are extensively employed in frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, where practitioners often save models after every certain number of epochs or when significant performance improvements are detected.

The practice of saving checkpoints became integral around the late 1990s and early 2000s with the rise of deep learning when training complex neural networks became computationally demanding. The term gained traction as the need for reliable and efficient methods to manage expensive and time-consuming training procedures emerged alongside the growing popularity of deep learning research and application.

Key contributors to the concept of checkpoints come from the broader community of AI researchers and open-source projects. The popularization and implementation within frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch owe much to the teams at Google Brain and Facebook AI Research, respectively, who developed robust mechanisms to manage the intricacies of model training and deployment at scale.
