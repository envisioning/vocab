summary: Process of actively seeking out new information to reduce uncertainty in an agent's understanding of the world, often driven by curiosity or the need to update beliefs about the environment.

**Epistemic Foraging** is central to decision-making models, particularly those grounded in active inference, where agents balance exploratory behaviors (for gathering information) with goal-directed actions.

In AI and cognitive science, epistemic foraging is often framed in the context of the *Free Energy Principle*, where agents engage in exploratory behaviors to minimize uncertainty about their internal models of the environment. This contrasts with purely reward-seeking (instrumental) actions, as epistemic actions prioritize knowledge acquisition to improve future decisions. The principle has applications in both biological systems (e.g., animal foraging) and AI, such as robots or synthetic agents learning through exploration in novel environments. For instance, autonomous systems may engage in "epistemic actions" like exploring uncertain parts of an environment to refine their internal world models, a crucial step in adaptive behaviors like navigation or problem-solving​([SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-89708-6_6))​([PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007805)).

Historically, the concept draws from foraging theory in biology, but it gained traction in AI and cognitive neuroscience in the early 2000s with the rise of active inference frameworks, particularly through the work of Karl Friston. His contributions integrated epistemic foraging into models of perception, cognition, and action by linking it to free-energy minimization​([Cambridge University Press & Assessment](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/value-of-uncertainty-an-active-inference-perspective/2B6DE47EBC4D0FD1D00531C6B7AB8EF6)). Other researchers, like Giovanni Pezzulo, have expanded on this to explore its role in decision-making and reinforcement learning​([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.802396/full)).
