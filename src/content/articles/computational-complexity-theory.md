Computational complexity theory is critical in AI as it establishes the theoretical underpinnings for understanding the efficiency of algorithms, influencing the design and feasibility of AI methods. It deals with classifying problems into complexity classes based on time or space resources needed for solving them on various computational models, such as deterministic, non-deterministic, or quantum computers. The theory aids in identifying the limits of what can be efficiently computed, directly affecting AI problem-solving methodologies and inspiring innovations in algorithm design, optimization, and resource management. Applications extend beyond AI, informing fields like cryptography, data mining, and operations research, by helping define what can be computed feasibly, thereby guiding realistic expectations from AI systems.

The term 'computational complexity' emerged in the 1960s as computer scientists sought to categorize problems by their solvability and resource requirements. The field gained traction in the 1970s with the formalization of complexity classes and the development of the P vs NP problem, sparked by interest in the computational difficulties inherent in AI and other domains.

Key contributors to computational complexity theory include Alan Cobham and Jack Edmonds, who were among the first to articulate the formal concepts of computational efficiency. Stephen Cook and Richard Karp further advanced the field with their groundbreaking work on NP-completeness, which has profound implications on AI and other computational disciplines by categorizing problems based on their reducibility and difficulty, thus framing our understanding of what constitutes computationally feasible AI tasks.
