A method that synthesizes a new image by optimizing or generating pixels so they match the content representations of one image and the style (correlation) statistics of another within a pretrained convolutional network.

Neural style transfer leverages feature representations learned by deep convolutional networks to disentangle high-level content (spatial layout and object structure) from low-level style (textures, color palettes, local correlations). The canonical formulation (Gatys et al., 2015) defines a content loss on selected feature activations and a style loss on Gram matrices (feature‑map correlations) computed across layers of a pretrained network (typically VGG), then either optimizes the pixels of an output image to minimize a weighted sum of these losses or trains a feedforward generator to approximate that optimization. This formulation made explicit that statistics of mid- and high-level features encode perceptual style and enabled practical variants: optimization-based transfer (high-quality but slow), feedforward/texture‑network approaches (real‑time at inference, trained to minimize perceptual losses), and later methods for arbitrary-style transfer, multi-style conditioning, and temporally consistent video stylization. Key technical considerations for experts include choice of layers and weights for content/style losses, use of Gram matrix vs. instance/adaptive normalization for style representation, trade-offs between perceptual fidelity and speed, and extensions integrating adversarial losses, spatial control, and domain adaptation.

First introduced in 2015 by Gatys, Ecker, and Bethge; it became widely popular in 2015–2016 as both the optimization-based method and fast feedforward approximations made high-quality artistic stylization practical and spawned many mobile and research applications.

Key contributors include Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge (original neural algorithm of artistic style, 2015); Justin Johnson, Alexandre Alahi, and Li Fei‑Fei (perceptual loss / feedforward transfer, 2016); Dmitry Ulyanov, Andrea Vedaldi, and Victor Lempitsky (texture networks / real-time approaches, 2016); Xun Huang and Serge Belongie (AdaIN for arbitrary real‑time transfer, 2017); Dumoulin, Shlens, and LeCun (conditional instance normalization for multi‑style models); and foundational contributors to the feature spaces used, notably Simonyan & Zisserman (VGG networks). Earlier non‑neural predecessors such as Hertzmann et al.'s image analogies (2001) also influenced the conceptual lineage.
