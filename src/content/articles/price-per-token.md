title: Price Per Token
---

In AI contexts, the price per token is crucial for understanding the computational cost associated with using language models, especially in pay-as-you-go systems or API-driven services where users are charged based on the number of tokens processed. A token can be as small as a single character or as large as a complete word, depending on the language and the model's tokenizer. For instance, when a model like GPT-4 processes input text, the total cost is determined by the number of tokens required to represent both the input and output. This metric is essential for managing usage costs and optimizing model performance, particularly in commercial or large-scale deployments where token usage can add up significantly.

Historically, this pricing model became popular around 2019 with the rise of large-scale AI models deployed commercially, such as OpenAI's GPT-3. As these models became more complex, the cost of tokenization became a key factor in determining the affordability and scalability of AI services.

OpenAI, Google, and other AI-focused organizations have contributed significantly to developing token-based pricing, especially as the need for efficient and scalable models increased with the growth of AI applications in industry.
