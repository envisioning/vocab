Data Efficient Learning is an aspect of ML (Machine Learning) where the focus lies on developing models that require less data to learn effectively. In an era where data-intensive applications are pervasive, being able to learn from small data could provide significant computational and resource advantages. A data-efficient learning approach allows for rapid learning and can aid in scenarios where limited datasets are available. For tasks like image or speech recognition, data-efficient learning can produce more streamlined and resource-efficient models, which are particularly crucial for edge devices with computational and power limitations.

In the history of ML, data has traditionally been a fundamental requirement, and often, more data led to better model performance. The buzzing interest around 'Big Data' peaked around 2015, but the concept of Data Efficient Learning, while not brand new, has gained more traction in recent years, notably due to the increasing need of learning in environments with data limitations.

The development of Data Efficient Learning correlates with advancements in areas of ML such as Few-Shot learning, Active Learning, and Transfer Learning. Notable figures in ML like Yoshua Bengio, a pioneer in Deep Learning, have contributed significantly to these aspects, thereby indirectly shaping the evolution of Data Efficient Learning.
