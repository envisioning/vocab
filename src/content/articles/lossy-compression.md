Lossy Compression plays a crucial role in the efficient storage and transmission of data, particularly where perfect accuracy is not necessary, such as in audio, image, and video files where human perception tolerates a degree of data loss. For AI applications, it proves significant by reducing the size of datasets needed for training models without a proportional impact on performance, facilitating faster processing and lessening computational load. This technique leverages psychoacoustic or visual models to identify and discard parts of data that are least perceptible to humans, thus preserving as much meaningful information as possible. While lossy compression may result in minor quality degradation, it is essential in many ML workflows where resource constraints and speed are prioritized over precision.

First used in the early 20th century, the concept of lossy compression gained widespread popularity in the mid-1990s with advancements in multimedia data processing and internet bandwidth optimizations.

Key developments in lossy compression were notably influenced by work from Karlheinz Brandenburg in his contribution to the MP3 audio format and the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) which standardized the JPEG image format, shaping how digital data is managed and compressed across industries.
