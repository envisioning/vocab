Predictive processing is a framework in cognitive science and AI suggesting that the brain functions as a probabilistic system constantly generating predictions about sensory inputs and continuously updating these predictions when faced with unexpected data. This concept has significant implications for developing AI models that mimic human-like perception by emphasizing prediction and error correction as core computational tasks. In AI, predictive processing helps design systems that can anticipate user needs, improve interaction effectiveness, and refine sensory-based learning processes. The framework also intersects with various AI methodologies, including Bayesian inference and HL (Hierarchical Learning), enhancing models with potentially greater adaptability and efficiency in dealing with uncertain environments or incomplete data.

The term predictive processing first appeared in cognitive neuroscience in the early 2000s, aligning with growing interests in anticipatory models during this time. It gained significant momentum and visibility within the AI community as a potent paradigm for building more efficient learning models around 2010.

Significant contributors to the predictive processing framework include Karl Friston, who developed the free energy principle that underpins much of the theory's formal basis. Friston's work, alongside contributions from philosophers like Andy Clark, has been instrumental in popularizing and evolving the concept, particularly in bridging neuroscience and AI.
