In AI and ML, the probability density function (PDF) is crucial for understanding the distribution of continuous data, allowing models to make predictions or decisions based on probabilistic reasoning. By defining the likelihood that a random variable falls within a specific range of values, the PDF provides a functional form to describe the variability of data. This concept is particularly important in probabilistic models and techniques such as Bayesian inference, where predicting the probability distributions of outcomes is essential. PDFs help in the computation of expectations, variances, and are widely used in model evaluation and parameter estimation in various AI applications, enhancing the ability of systems to handle uncertainty and variability in real-world data.

The term "probability density function" was first used in statistical contexts in the early 20th century, with its popularity growing as statistical approaches became fundamental to various scientific disciplines. The concept became particularly pervasive in AI and related fields in the late 20th century as probabilistic models gained prominence.

Key contributors to the development of probability theory and the concept of the probability density function include Thomas Bayes, whose theorem underpins much of Bayesian statistics, as well as Pierre-Simon Laplace and Abraham de Moivre, who contributed significantly to the groundwork of probability theory and analysis.
