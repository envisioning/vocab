In AI, the Distillation Method focuses on compressing large and complex models into simpler versions while retaining essential functionalities and efficiency. This method is particularly vital in contexts where computational resources are limited, such as deploying AI applications on edge devices or mobile systems. The process involves training a smaller model, termed the 'student', using the predictions of a larger, pre-trained 'teacher' model, leveraging soft labels to capture more information than hard labels would. By approximating the behavior of the cumbersome teacher model, the student model aims to replicate the original model's capabilities with significantly reduced memory and computation needs, thus facilitating more extensive real-world applications of AI models.

The term "Distillation Method" became widely recognized around 2015, following the publication of Geoffrey Hinton and his teamâ€™s seminal paper on 'Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network', which has since spurred extensive research in model compression techniques across AI disciplines.

Key contributors to the development and popularization of the distillation concept include Geoffrey Hinton, a renowned figure in deep learning, who, along with his team, laid the foundational framework for knowledge distillation in neural networks, thus influencing a wide array of subsequent innovations in efficient AI model design.
