Surprisal quantifies how surprising an event is by computing the negative logarithm of the probability of an event occurring, derived from information theory. This concept is significant in AI as it offers a mathematical way to assess and interpret the unpredictability inherent in model predictions, especially when dealing with probabilistic models and decision-making under uncertainty. In the context of AI, surprisal is often applied in fields such as natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning to ascertain the informativeness or rarity of specific data points. By considering surprisal, algorithms can prioritize learning from less predictable data, thereby potentially increasing efficiency in model convergence and optimizing resource allocation during training processes.

The term "surprisal" was first introduced by Myron Tribus around 1956, with its roots in Shannon's information theory; however, it became more widely recognized and utilized within AI and related fields in the late 20th and early 21st century as computational models began to emphasize probabilistic reasoning more heavily.

Key contributors to the concept of surprisal include Myron Tribus, who is credited with coining the term, and Claude Shannon, whose foundational work in information theory laid the groundwork for understanding and harnessing concepts like surprisal within AI frameworks. These contributions have allowed for the broader application of information-theoretical measures in evaluating AI performance and decision-making processes.
