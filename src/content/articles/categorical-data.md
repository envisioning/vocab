In AI and ML, categorical data is pivotal for tasks involving classification, clustering, and pattern recognition, where data points are classified into distinct categories or labels, each representing a qualitative attribute. Categorical features can be nominal, where categories have no intrinsic order, or ordinal, where the order matters but not the distance between categories. Handling categorical data effectively is crucial for model training, necessitating techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding to convert such data into a numeric format suitable for models. This data type often poses significant challenges in algorithm development and optimization due to its non-numeric nature, emphasizing the need for specialized preprocessing and feature extraction techniques.

The term began gaining traction in statistical literature in the mid-20th century; however, it rose to prominence with the surge of AI applications and ML techniques in the 1980s and 1990s. Its widespread popularity in contemporary AI is attributed to the growing recognition of the importance of non-numeric data in building robust and accurate prediction models.

Influential contributors to the conceptual framework and practical applications of categorical data include statisticians such as John Tukey and data scientists who laid the groundwork for statistical learning methods, allowing for broader understanding and utilization of non-numeric data within the fields of AI and ML.
