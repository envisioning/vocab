Spatial autoencoders are specialized neural network architectures designed to exploit the inherent spatial structure within data, such as images or volumetric data, facilitating the learning of compact and representative features without labeled input. They employ the traditional autoencoder framework, consisting of an encoder to compress data into a latent space and a decoder to reconstruct the input, but are specifically adapted to preserve and emphasize spatial relationships present within the dataset. This approach is particularly beneficial in computer vision and robot perception tasks, where understanding spatial arrangements is crucial. By utilizing convolutional layers and leveraging spatial hierarchies, these autoencoders enhance the model's ability to extract meaningful spatial features, enabling applications in unsupervised representation learning, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction of complex spatial datasets.

The concept of spatial autoencoder emerged around the early to mid-2010s, gaining traction with the rising interest in deep learning and its application to image processing and computer vision tasks. As researchers sought more efficient ways to handle the spatial complexities of data within unsupervised learning frameworks, spatial autoencoders began to see increased implementation and development.

Key contributors to the development of spatial autoencoders include researchers and engineers from academia and industry, focusing on deep learning and computer vision advancements. While no single individual is credited with the invention, notable progress can be attributed to the collective efforts within labs globally, particularly from those involved in pioneering convolutional neural networks and their capabilities in recognizing spatial patterns.
