title: Surprise

Surprise in AI refers to measuring the degree of unexpectedness or novelty in the outcomes produced by an AI system. It is a subfield of AI that involves determining how far off the actual predictions or results are from what the AI system initially expected. This concept is particularly useful in domains like anomaly detection where identifying significant deviations from the norm is crucial. It also has applications in reinforcement learning where an AI agent leverages surprise to discover new, potentially rewarding strategies.

Historically, the concept of surprise in AI is not tied to a specific date or period as it naturally arises as AI systems evolved to learn from their environment and adapt their behavior. However, the concept has gained more attention in the last two decades with the advancements of AI technologies.

Key contributors to this research field include but are not limited to pioneers in the field of AI and ML such as Judea Pearl and Ronald A. Howard, who have contributed extensively to theories of decision-making under uncertainty which implicitly involves managing surprise or unexpected outcomes.
