Indirect manipulation in AI and user interface design refers to the method where users operate on data or systems not by directly engaging with them but through commands or actions that abstract or mediate the intended outcome. Its significance lies in scenarios where direct interaction is not feasible or optimal, leveraging automation, scripting, or higher-level commands to achieve desired results. Such techniques are pivotal in complex systems where users handle high-level functions that necessitate intermediary actions, such as in large-scale data processing, AI model training, or sophisticated software environments where users command certain responses through predefined interfaces without direct, granular control over the computational processes. This approach can enhance usability by simplifying interactions and reducing cognitive load, allowing users to focus on broader objectives without delving into technical specifics.

The concept of indirect manipulation has roots in early user interface research around the 1970s and 1980s, gaining more prominence in the 1990s with the rise of graphical user interfaces and automated systems. The terminology and its applications have matured significantly as advancements in AI and ML necessitated more abstraction in user-system interaction.

Key contributors to the development of indirect manipulation concepts include pioneers in human-computer interaction such as Ben Shneiderman, who explored the balance between direct controls and higher-level abstractions to streamline user experiences and interface intuitiveness.
