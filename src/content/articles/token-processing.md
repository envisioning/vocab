Token processing is a critical preprocessing step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves segmenting text into individual units called tokens, which may represent words, sentences, or subword parts depending on the context and language characteristics. This segmentation allows NLP models to understand and manipulate text data effectively, supporting a diverse range of applications from text classification and sentiment analysis to language modeling and machine translation. The granular control over textual data that token processing offers enables models to handle complex languages and adapt to specific vocabularies, enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of various AI systems.

The concept of tokenization first emerged in the early 1960s as computational linguistics began to take shape, but it gained significant traction with the rise of NLP in the late 1990s and became increasingly sophisticated with the development of advanced models and deep learning techniques in the 2010s.

Key contributions to token processing have come from the broader fields of NLP and computational linguistics, with major advances credited to the development teams behind foundational NLP libraries and frameworks such as NLTK, spaCy, and Hugging Face's Transformers, which have integrated effective tokenization methodologies into their tools.
