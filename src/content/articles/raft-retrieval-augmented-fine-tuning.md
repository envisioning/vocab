title: RAFT (Retrieval Augmented Fine Tuning)  
summary: An advanced approach in AI that improves a model's performance by fine-tuning it with additional context retrieved from large datasets or knowledge bases.

RAFT enhances pre-trained language models by incorporating retrieval mechanisms that access relevant external information during the fine-tuning process, thus allowing the model to generate more context-aware and accurate responses even with limited specialized training data. This method is significant in AI because it enables models to leverage substantial external knowledge effectively without needing to be explicitly programmed with that data. It can be particularly advantageous in scenarios where models need up-to-date or wide-ranging information, bridging the gap between static training data and dynamic, real-world queries. By integrating retrieval systems that fetch pertinent information from expansive data sources, RAFT empowers AI models to make more informed decisions and produce results that reflect a broader understanding than their initial training data might afford. 

The concept of Retrieval Augmented Fine Tuning began gaining attention around 2020, as researchers sought to improve contextual relevance in large language models and bridge limitations in static dataset training that struggled to keep pace with evolving data.  

Key contributors to the development of RAFT include AI research teams from companies like Google and OpenAI, which have been focusing on augmenting language model capabilities with retrieval mechanisms, inspired by the demand for real-time applicability and accuracy in AI systems.
