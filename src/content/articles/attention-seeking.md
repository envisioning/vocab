In the realm of AI, attention seeking refers to a mechanism commonly used in neural network architectures, especially in models handling sequential data like NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks. The attention mechanism allows a model to weigh different parts of the input data—typically sequences or sets of items—based on their relevance to the output task. This is especially significant in Transformer models, where attention layers help in focusing on different parts of a sentence when processing language, enabling the network to capture relationships between words irrespective of their position. Attention mechanisms have proven to be transformative in reducing computational complexity and improving both the interpretability and performance of deep learning models.

The year 2017 marked the popularization of attention mechanisms with the introduction of the Transformer model, although the foundational concept was established earlier in 2014 with the development of the attention-driven approach for RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks).

Key figures in the development of attention mechanisms include Dzmitry Bahdanau, who introduced the attention model in the context of NLP, and the research team at Google Brain, including Ashish Vaswani and colleagues, who significantly advanced the field with their work on the Transformer model.
