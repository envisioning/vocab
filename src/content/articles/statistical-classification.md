Statistical classification is a core problem in ML and AI, dealing with algorithms that assign labels to data points by leveraging statistical techniques. In AI, it forms the backbone of supervised learning tasks, where the model learns to predict a discrete label based on the input features provided during training. Key methods include linear classifiers, decision trees, and more sophisticated techniques like support vector machines and neural networks, with deep learning advancing the capabilities of classification on large and complex datasets. Statistical classification is crucial across numerous fields such as spam detection, medical diagnosis, and image recognition, addressing both binary and multi-class problems.

The concept of statistical classification can trace its origins to the early development of statistical methods in the 18th and 19th centuries, gaining substantial traction in the field of AI and ML around the mid-20th century. It began to gain widespread popularity with the advent of digital computers in the 1960s and exploded in practical applications with the growth of digital data and advancements in computing power in the 1990s and 2000s. 

Key contributors to the development of statistical classification include Ronald A. Fisher, whose work on discriminant analysis laid foundational principles in the early 20th century, and Frank Rosenblatt, known for his development of the perceptron algorithm in the 1950s, which paved the way for neural network-based classification methods.
