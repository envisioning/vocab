---

Causal AI is an advanced form of artificial intelligence that simulates human reasoning capabilities by considering not just patterns or correlations in data, but also cause-and-effect relationships. This understanding makes Causal AI models markedly more interpretable, unlocking a detailed understanding of why a model makes a decision or prediction, since it looks at causal factors rather than mere associations. By reasoning with cause-effect relationships similar to human cognitive models, Causal AI provides better decision-making support and opens new doors to applications across various fields like healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems where understanding the underlying reasons for a decision is critical.

While the concept of causality has been explored in the philosophy and mathematics for centuries, its integration into AI gained momentum in the early 21st century as a response to the concerns about interpretability and transparency of ML (Machine Learning) models. The term "Causal AI" started gaining popularity in the late 2010s as advancements in the field allowed for the development of more sophisticated causal inference models.

Judea Pearl, a computer scientist and philosopher, is most notably associated with the formalization of causality in artificial intelligence. His work in the field of causal inference has created a foundation for the integration of causal reasoning in AI systems. Other researchers within AI and statistics have also made significant contributions to this field, leading to the development and refinement of Causal AI.
