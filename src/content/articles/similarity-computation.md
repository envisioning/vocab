In AI, similarity computation is integral for tasks such as clustering, classification, and recommendation systems. It involves metrics like Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, or Jaccard index to determine how closely related different data points are within a dataset. In ML (Machine Learning), these measures allow algorithms to group similar items, distinguish distinct categories, or identify underlying patterns, making similarity computation critical for applications ranging from natural language processing to image recognition. The significance of this concept is highlighted in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), where predicting the classification of a point is based on its proximity to other points, leveraging similarity measures. As models and data become more complex, accurate similarity computation allows systems to scale and improve their predictive performance, maintaining coherence across increasingly diverse datasets.

The concept of quantifying similarity between entities has been around for decades, but it gained prominence with the rise of ML in the late 20th century. The development of advanced algorithms that could leverage similarity measures effectively became more significant in the 1990s and 2000s as computational power and data availability expanded.

Key contributors to the development of similarity computation in AI include researchers like R. A. Fisher for pioneering statistical distance measures, and later, computer scientists who expanded on these foundations to develop efficient algorithms for similarity-based learning in ML contexts.
