A Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that operates in the extreme regime of expert count, using gating or routing mechanisms to activate only a few experts out of millions for each input; this enables models with orders-of-magnitude more parameters (capacity) than dense counterparts while maintaining comparable inference and training FLOPs by exploiting sparse, conditional computation and careful system-level sharding.

Technically, the approach extends the MoE principle—multiple specialist subnetworks ("experts") combined by a learned router—into a regime where expert count is extremely large (hundreds of thousands to millions). The router (typically a learned softmax/top-k gating function, hashed routing, or hybrid schemes) maps tokens or instances to a small set of experts, producing sparse gradients and forward passes. The design trades statistical capacity for infrastructure complexity: the main benefits are dramatic parameter scaling for long-tail or multilingual specialization, improved sample efficiency for rare-context modeling, and modular upgradeability (add/remove experts). The challenges are algorithmic (routing collapse, load imbalance, gate overconfidence, stable optimization with sparse gradient paths), systems-level (memory fragmentation, all-to-all communication, expert placement, checkpointing, parameter server vs. sharded-memory strategies), and evaluation (measuring true compute vs. capacity gains, fairness of expert assignment). Practical techniques include auxiliary load-balancing losses, expert dropout/regularization, sparsity-aware optimizers, quantized or offloaded expert weights, hierarchical or hashed routing to reduce metadata, and topology-aware placement (e.g., GShard/GSPMD-style partitioning) to manage cross-device communication. In ML (Machine Learning) and AI workloads, million-expert MoEs are especially attractive for massively multilingual models, personalized/federated expert pools, and modular multimodal stacks where specialization yields better tail performance than uniform dense scaling.

First-use context: the Mixture-of-Experts idea dates to the early 1990s (Jacobs et al., 1991) as a statistical ensemble of specialists; sparse, large-scale MoE architectures reappeared in deep learning with Shazeer et al.'s sparsely-gated MoE (2017), and the push to thousands-to-millions of experts emerged with system and scaling papers around 2020–2024 (e.g., GShard 2020, Switch Transformer 2021 and subsequent extreme-scale MoE work), when infrastructure and routing techniques made extreme expert counts tractable.

Key contributors and groups: early theoretical work by Michael I. Jordan, Robert A. Jacobs and colleagues; modern sparse MoE revival led by Noam Shazeer et al. (Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts), large-scale systems and routing innovations from Google Research teams (GShard, Lepikhin et al.), architects of Switch Transformer (William Fedus, Barret Zoph, Noam Shazeer), and broader systems and scaling contributions from groups at DeepMind, OpenAI, and Microsoft Research; ongoing progress also rests on contributions in distributed ML (Mesh TensorFlow, GSPMD, Alpa), routing algorithms, and optimization techniques by many research and engineering teams.
