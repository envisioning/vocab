In AI, data analysis is a critical process involving the systematic application of statistical and logical techniques to evaluate data, enabling the transformation of raw data into meaningful insights for model training and validation. Leveraging methodologies from various subfields such as statistical analysis, data mining, and predictive analytics, it serves as a foundation for developing AI algorithms and models by allowing practitioners to understand patterns within the data that inform model feature selection, bias reduction, and result interpretation. As AI systems increasingly rely on vast amounts of structured and unstructured data, data analysis becomes indispensable for ensuring data quality, understanding data distributions, and ultimately, improving AI system performance and trustworthiness.

The use of data analysis can be traced back to the early 20th century with advancements in statistics, but its significance surged alongside the development of computing technologies in the mid-20th century. It gained notable popularity in the 2000s with the rise of AI and big data, as more advanced computational power allowed for unprecedented data handling capabilities.

Renowned contributors to the evolution of data analysis in the context of AI include pioneers like John Tukey, who advocated for exploratory data analysis in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as modern AI leaders like Jeff Dean and Andrew Ng, who emphasized the importance of data quality and large-scale data utilization in training robust AI models.
