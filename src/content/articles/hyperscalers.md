Hyperscalers are the large tech companies that are best known for dealing with the capabilities of massive scaling. They typically own and manage IT infrastructure at an immense scale, providing services for storing, analyzing, and gaining insights from large volumes of data. Their infrastructure powers big data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and cloud computing. They have the ability to elastically scale infrastructure in response to rapidly changing computing demands, which is a core requirement for supporting AI processing and applications.

The term 'Hyperscalers' started gaining traction in the IT industry in the early 21st century. It gained popularity in sync with the rise of big tech companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google that have the means and expertise to implement hyperscale computing.

Major players such as Amazon with AWS, Google with Google Cloud, and Microsoft with Azure are examples of companies known as Hyperscalers. They significantly contribute to the development and adoption of the Hyperscale computing model, using their infrastructure to provide robust support to AI and Machine Learning (ML) tasks.
