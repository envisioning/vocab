title: Personal Software
---

Personal Software in the context of AI refers to software designed to learn and adapt to individual behaviors, preferences and routines, with the aim to assist in executing tasks. As a form of AI agent, this type of software leverages data exposure through user interaction to learn more about personal patterns and make inferences that can help facilitate task execution. Technologically driven by complex algorithms and machine learning models, Personal Software can take various forms ranging from personal digital assistants to recommenders in different industries like e-commerce, music, or movies.

While software has been personalized to user preferences for decades, the infusion of AI into personalizing software started in earnest in the early 2000s, with the development of recommendation engines and intelligent digital assistants.

Major tech companies like Apple, Google and Amazon have played a pivotal role in the evolution of personal software. For instance, Apple's Siri, Google's Google Assistant, and Amazon's Alexa are all AI-driven personal software which have heavily influenced the development and adaptation of personal software with AI proficiency. They learn from user behaviors and can execute tasks based on inferences from these behaviors.
