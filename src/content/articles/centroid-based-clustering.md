Centroid-based clustering is a pivotal method in unsupervised ML, where the objective is to partition a set of data points into distinct clusters, each characterized by its centroid, such as the mean of points in a cluster. This approach is significant due to its simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for large datasets across various domains like image compression, market segmentation, and anomaly detection. The most renowned algorithm in this category is k-means clustering, which iteratively refines cluster centroids to minimize the variance within each cluster. Despite its computational efficiency, centroid-based clustering can be sensitive to initial centroid selection and the presence of outliers, prompting further research into more robust variations and initialization methods to enhance its performance and applicability in complex datasets.

The concept of clustering dates back several decades, with early formal uses in computer science emerging in the 1960s and gaining notable traction with the introduction of the k-means algorithm in the 1980s, particularly due to its implementation in various practical and academic settings.

The development of centroid-based clustering techniques can be attributed to several key contributors, most notably Stuart Lloyd, who introduced the k-means algorithm as a quantization framework in the 1950s. His work laid a foundation that numerous researchers have since expanded upon, evolving it into a versatile tool for data analysis in AI.
