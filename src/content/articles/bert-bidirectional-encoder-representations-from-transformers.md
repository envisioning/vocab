BERT, introduced by Google in 2018, marks a pivotal shift in how machine learning models grasp the nuances of language. Unlike previous models that processed text in one direction (either left-to-right or right-to-left), BERT considers the full context of a word by looking at the words that come before and after it. This approach allows BERT to capture a more nuanced understanding of language, leading to substantial improvements across a wide range of NLP tasks, such as question answering, language inference, and sentiment analysis. The model employs the Transformer architecture, focusing on self-attention mechanisms that weigh the relevance of each word in a sentence to every other word, thus capturing the complexities of language more effectively than ever before.

BERT was introduced in a paper titled "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding" by researchers at Google AI Language in 2018. Its introduction marked a significant moment in NLP research, as it quickly set new state-of-the-art benchmarks across numerous NLP tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of its bidirectional training and deep learning strategies based on the Transformer architecture introduced in 2017.

The development of BERT was led by Jacob Devlin and his team at Google. Devlin, along with Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova, were pivotal in crafting the model's architecture and demonstrating its effectiveness across a range of language understanding tasks, laying foundational work for subsequent models and research in the field of NLP.
