summary: Cognitive ability to attribute mental states—such as beliefs, intentions,
  desires, and knowledge—to oneself and others, allowing one to understand that others
  have perspectives and intentions that differ from one's own.
title: ToM (Theory of Mind)
---

- In AI, Theory of Mind refers to the effort to model systems capable of understanding and predicting human mental states, enabling machines to interpret and respond to the intentions, goals, and emotions of human users. This concept is essential for advancing human-AI interaction, as it underpins machines' ability to engage in more natural, adaptive communication and collaboration. ToM is particularly relevant in contexts like autonomous agents, social robotics, and virtual assistants, where understanding human behavior and anticipating responses is crucial for effective interaction. Developing AI with Theory of Mind capabilities is an ongoing challenge, involving advancements in both machine learning and cognitive science, as it requires models capable of reasoning about both explicit and implicit human intentions and beliefs.
- The term "Theory of Mind" was first introduced in psychology in 1978 by David Premack and Guy Woodruff in their work on chimpanzees' ability to understand human intentions. It became widely discussed in cognitive science and developmental psychology during the 1980s and 1990s, especially through studies on child development. In AI, the concept gained attention in the early 2000s as researchers began integrating psychological insights into machine learning and robotics.
- David Premack and Guy Woodruff are credited with introducing the term in the context of animal and human cognition. In AI, researchers from interdisciplinary fields such as Alan Leslie and Simon Baron-Cohen in developmental psychology, and more recently in AI, Fei-Fei Li and teams at institutions like MIT and Stanford have been influential in exploring cognitive architectures and machine learning systems that simulate aspects of Theory of Mind in artificial agents.
