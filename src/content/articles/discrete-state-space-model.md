Within AI, a discrete state-space model is essential for modeling systems whose state transitions occur at discrete time steps, capturing the dynamics using state variables that evolve according to a predefined function. These models are crucial in control systems, robotics, and signal processing, as they provide a framework to represent systems with finite, determined states, enabling the analysis and prediction of the system's behavior over time. The use of such models allows for efficient handling of complex systems where it is possible to manage and compute the evolution of system states, making them integral for designing algorithms that require state estimation, fault detection, and adaptive control. Techniques based on Markov models and dynamic Bayesian networks often utilize discrete state-space representations, especially in applications where system behavior can be stochastically influenced by past states and inputs.

The term "discrete state-space model" can trace its earliest use to the late 1950s in control theory, with increased popularity through the 1970s as digital computing systems became more ubiquitous, offering the computational power necessary to implement complex models and algorithms that were difficult to manage manually.

Key figures who contributed significantly to the development of state-space models, particularly in the discrete case, include Rudolf E. Kalman, whose pioneering work on state-space representation in the late 1950s and early 1960s introduced concepts such as the Kalman filter, which remains fundamental in signal processing and control within both AI and broader engineering contexts.
