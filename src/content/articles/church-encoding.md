Church Encoding is a seminal method in the theory of computation, wherein data like numbers and logical operators are expressed solely as functions using the lambda calculus, providing a foundation for understanding key concepts in functional programming and the mechanization of logic. This method is pivotal for exploring the expressiveness of the lambda calculus, as it demonstrates how fundamental data types can be mapped using functions and application, thus lending a mathematical and abstract structure to both computation and programming language theory. Church Encoding's theoretical underpinning is crucial for AI research focused on functional programming paradigms and understanding computation from a mathematical standpoint, particularly impacting areas such as the design of interpreters and compilers that leverage recursive function theory.

Church Encoding was introduced by Alonzo Church in the 1930s, and its significance was recognized throughout the 20th century, gaining broader popularity as the theories of lambda calculus and functional programming became foundational in computer science and AI research during the late 1900s.

Key contributions to the development of Church Encoding primarily credit Alonzo Church, whose pioneering work in formalizing the lambda calculus laid the groundwork for much of modern theoretical computer science, influencing subsequent researchers in logic, mathematics, and AI.
