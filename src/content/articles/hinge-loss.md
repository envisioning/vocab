Hinge loss is crucial in ML, especially for its application in support vector machines (SVM) where it helps to maximize the margin between data points and the decision boundary. This loss function is defined as max(0, 1 - y*f(x)), where y is the true label and f(x) is the predicted score; its function promotes correctly classified observations with a minimal distance from the decision boundary and penalizes misclassifications more heavily. The hinge loss is not differentiable at the hinge (when y*f(x) = 1), but is still sub-differentiable, allowing for optimization using methods like sub-gradient descent. Its design effectively pushes the decision boundary away from any data point, ensuring robustness against outliers and improving generalization.

First introduced around the early 1990s, hinge loss became prominently recognized with the introduction and popularization of support vector machines in the mid-to-late 1990s as researchers explored effective ways to improve classification accuracy through margin maximization.

Key contributors to the concept of hinge loss include Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis, who were instrumental in developing the theoretical foundations of support vector machines, a framework that significantly popularized the use of hinge loss.
