Symbolic Computing is a cornerstone of classical AI, emphasizing the use of high-level human-readable symbols and logic to represent knowledge and solve problems. It operates on the premise that human thought processes can be emulated by manipulating symbols in a structured way, integrating mechanisms such as logic and rules-based systems. This paradigm facilitates the encoding of explicit knowledge and inference, making it adept for tasks requiring deep reasoning and transparency, such as theorem proving, symbolic algebra, and expert systems. Conversely, while highly interpretable, Symbolic Computing struggles with scalability and handling unstructured data, challenges that sub-symbolic methods like ML aim to address.

The term Symbolic Computing, tracing its origins back to the mid-20th century, gained prominence in the 1960s as AI researchers established systems like the Logic Theorist and SHRDLU, which demonstrated the feasibility of using symbolic reasoning for complex problem-solving.

Pioneers such as Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon, developers of the first AI program, the Logic Theorist, alongside Terry Winograd, who developed SHRDLU, were instrumental in advancing Symbolic Computing. Their work laid the foundations for subsequent developments in AI, highlighting the potential and limitations of symbolic approaches.
