Lambda Calculus is crucial in the foundation of AI, providing a framework for defining computable functions and serving as a theoretical backbone for functional programming languages widely used in AI systems today. It offers a minimalist view of computation, focusing on the abstraction (creation) of functions and their applications, which helps in understanding the execution of complex mathematical processes using simple rewriting rules. Lambda Calculus also underpins the semantics of computation in various AI contexts, affording rich representations of algorithms in concise forms, and is instrumental in evaluating symbolic computations and transformations, critical in fields such as automatic theorem proving and symbolic AI.

Introduced by Alonzo Church in the 1930s, Lambda Calculus began gaining recognition throughout the mid-20th century with the burgeoning fields of computer science and the development of programming languages influenced by its principles.

The foremost contributor to the development of Lambda Calculus is Alonzo Church, who introduced it as part of his work on the foundations of mathematics. Church's contributions significantly shaped theoretical computer science, which later influenced AI research through functional programming's practical implementations.
