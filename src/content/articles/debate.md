Debate as a supervision method in AI is a concept where AI models or agents are structured to argue opposing sides of an issue or question, with the objective of elucidating truth or reaching a more accurate outcome through the dialectic process. This method takes inspiration from human debate, where the presentation and counteraction of arguments can lead to a deeper understanding or refinement of ideas. In AI, debate serves not only to refine the decision-making capabilities and ethical reasoning of models but also to expose underlying assumptions and biases, offering a unique pathway to interpretability. Applications of this method include areas like AI safety, where it's essential to scrutinize and validate the rationale behind AI decisions, ensuring they align with human values and societal norms.

The concept of using debate as a supervision method in AI emerged prominently around 2018, when researchers sought innovative ways to improve AI alignment and interpretability, gaining traction as a distinctive tool for robust decision-making in AI systems.

Key contributors to the development of this concept include researchers at OpenAI, particularly Geoffrey Irving and Paul Christiano, who have advocated for debate frameworks within AI systems as part of enhancing their safety and interpretability. Their work has laid the foundation for further exploration and integration of debate in AI supervision strategies.
