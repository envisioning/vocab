Feature learning is a pivotal technique in AI and ML where algorithms autonomously identify and extract useful patterns or features from raw input data, enhancing a model's predictive performance and minimizing the exhaustive task of manual feature engineering. This approach is critical in complex domains, such as image and speech recognition, where raw data is high-dimensional and unstructured. The principal goal of feature learning is to enable models to discern non-linear relationships and extract hierarchically structured features that capture intrinsic data properties, often using neural networks and deep learning frameworks. Techniques like autoencoders, Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) epitomize the core methodologies used in feature learning, facilitating significant advancements in AI applications.

The term 'feature learning' began appearing in literature in the late 2000s, gaining prominence around 2012 as deep learning architectures demonstrated superior performance in handling high-dimensional data inputs, marking a shift from traditional, manual feature extraction methods.

Key contributors to feature learning include Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio, who collectively pioneered developments in neural networks and deep learning that are crucial to automating feature extraction, earning them the renowned title of the "Godfathers of AI" due to their foundational work in this field.
