title: LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
---

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a type of probabilistic model utilized in the field of natural language processing (NLP) for topic discovery or topic modeling. This model essentially helps in identifying latent or unseen topics that are present in a collection of documents (corpus). In practice, LDA assumes that each document in the corpus is created by a mixture of different topics, and each topic is characterized by a distribution over the corpus's words. This makes LDA a powerful tool for text analytics, where it's used for document classification, summarization, personal recommendation engines, and more.

Historically, the groundwork for Latent Dirichlet Allocation was laid in 2003. It was presented in a paper titled "Latent Dirichlet Allocation", published in the Journal of Machine Learning Research. The concept rapidly gained popularity as a primary method for topic modeling due to its capabilities to identify topics based on underlying structures such as word frequency and relationships.

The key contributors to the development of LDA are David Blei, Andrew Ng, and Michael I. Jordan, who jointly devised and presented the concept in their 2003 publication. By uncovering themes or subjects within large volumes of unstructured text data, their innovative approach revolutionized the field of topic modeling.
