Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is a fundamental error metric used in the evaluation of ML models, specifically regression models, by calculating the average of the absolute differences between predicted values and actual values in a given dataset. This metric provides a straightforward interpretation of prediction accuracy, where a lower MAE indicates better model performance; it is especially valuable for its robustness against outlier sensitivity compared to metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE). Despite its simplicity, MAE is crucial for model validation and comparison, serving applications ranging from financial forecasting to autonomous systems, where precise estimation is critical. By offering an unambiguous error measurement that maintains the same unit as the target variable, MAE facilitates direct interpretation and practical decision-making.

The concept of Mean Absolute Error has roots tracing back to error measurement practices in classical statistics, however, it gained significant traction and popularity during the late 20th century, alongside the development and acceleration of computational models and ML in the 1990s and early 2000s. 

While the exact attribution of MAE's development in the AI domain is diffuse given its statistical nature, its widespread adoption in ML has been influenced by key contributions from statisticians and computer scientists who have highlighted its utility and effectiveness in numerous research papers, particularly in the context of robust modeling and evaluation techniques.
