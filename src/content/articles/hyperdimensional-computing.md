title: Hyperdimensional Computing
---

Hyperdimensional Computing utilizes properties of high-dimensional vector spaces, typically comprising thousands of dimensions, to represent and process data in a way that mimics certain aspects of human cognition more flexibly and scalably than traditional methods. This computational paradigm emerges from the observation that high-dimensional spaces offer unique mathematical properties, such as expressivity and error tolerance, making them well-suited for encoding, storing, and manipulating information robustly. It allows parallel and distributed processing, advantageous for implementing associative memory and performing operations like superposition and permutation efficiently. The approach is gaining traction in AI for applications that require reliability and adaptability, including cognitive computing, robotics, and neural network architectures, where it supports the development of models that inherently resist noise and data loss.

First introduced in the early 1990s, Hyperdimensional Computing started gaining popularity around the late 2010s, as interest surged in utilizing biologically plausible models to enhance AI systems' performance and robustness.

Significant contributions to the development of Hyperdimensional Computing have been made by researchers such as Pentti Kanerva, who is often credited with pioneering work in this area through his theory of sparse distributed memory and the introduction of high-dimensional representation in cognitive modeling.
