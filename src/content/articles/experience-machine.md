The "experience machine" is a hypothetical construct introduced by philosopher Robert Nozick to challenge the notion of hedonism in the context of utility and value theory. It posits a device capable of providing any desired pleasurable or meaningful experience to an individual through full immersive simulation, prompting reflection on the intrinsic value of authenticity and real-life interactions contrary to mere pleasurable experiences. The thought experiment is significant in AI ethics discussions, especially concerning virtual realities and the development of AI technologies capable of creating simulated environments, raising questions about the potential consequences and desirability of seeking fulfillment through artificial means rather than authentic experiences.

The experience machine concept was first introduced in 1974 in Robert Nozick's book "Anarchy, State, and Utopia," gaining broader prominence and discussion in philosophical and AI circles as virtual reality technologies began developing in the 1990s.

Robert Nozick is the key contributor to the development of the experience machine concept, as it originated with his philosophical arguments against hedonism and it has since become a foundational discourse in the realm concerning the ethics of AI and virtual reality.
