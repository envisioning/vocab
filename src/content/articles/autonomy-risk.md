Autonomy risk is a critical concept in AI, reflecting the potential dangers posed by autonomous systems, such as AI-driven vehicles or decision-making algorithms, that may malfunction, act unpredictably, or operate independently from human oversight. This risk becomes significant in contexts where autonomous systems are deployed in safety-critical or mission-critical environments, such as healthcare, military, or transportation, where unintended actions can have severe repercussions. Specifically, these risks encompass technical failures, ethical dilemmas, and unanticipated socio-economic impacts due to AI systems potentially operating outside their predefined boundaries or objectives. The assessment and management of autonomy risk involve advanced methodologies like verification and validation processes, reinforced policies, and continuous monitoring systems to ensure that AI applications align with human values and intent.

The term autonomy risk started to surface around the late 2000s as autonomous systems began to proliferate and concerns about their potential unintended consequences emerged. It gained wider attention with the increasing deployment and commercialization of AI technologies in sectors involving high-stakes decision-making, particularly post-2015 as AI applications expanded.

Key contributors to the development and exploration of autonomy risk are often researchers and practitioners in AI ethics, safety, and policy, such as Stuart Russell and Nick Bostrom. Strategies to mitigate these risks are continually evolving, with contributions from organizations like the IEEE, OpenAI, and various academic institutions conducting pivotal research in identifying and managing the risks associated with autonomous AI systems.
