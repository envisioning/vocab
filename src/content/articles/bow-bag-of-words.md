The bag-of-words (BoW) model is a foundational technique in natural language processing that converts text into a fixed-length vector, representing the frequency of words appearing in a document while disregarding grammar and word order. This simplicity allows for the efficient analysis of large text corpora and is particularly useful in tasks like document classification, spam detection, and sentiment analysis. BoW treats each document as a 'bag' containing some number of words without any information about sequences, which simplifies computation but also limits the ability to understand context or semantics beyond single words.

The concept of the bag-of-words model has been around since the 1950s, with its use in machine learning and text analysis becoming prominent in the 1990s as part of the growth of statistical methods in NLP.

The development of the BoW model is attributed to the broader field of linguistics and computer science without a single key contributor. Its evolution has been influenced significantly by the work in statistical language modeling and the rise of machine learning approaches in NLP.
