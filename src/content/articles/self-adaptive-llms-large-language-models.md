Models that autonomously adjust prompts, parameters, inference strategies, or deployment behavior at runtime to improve task performance, robustness, or efficiency without requiring full offline retraining.

Self-adaptive LLMs are LLMs augmented with mechanisms for online or iterative adaptation—such as prompt rewriting, internal deliberation and self-correction, lightweight parameter adapters, meta-learned update rules, or reinforcement-style fine-tuning—that allow the model to change its outputs or internal configuration in response to new data, feedback, or distribution shift. The concept draws on ML (Machine Learning) subfields including meta-learning (e.g., MAML-style rapid adaptation), continual/online learning, and policy optimization from RL, and it leverages engineering patterns like modular adapters, preference- or reward-based fine-tuning (RLHF/RLAIF), and automated prompt engineering. In practice, self-adaptive LLMs enable personalization, domain transfer, improved robustness to distributional drift, and agentic behaviors (autonomous task decomposition and iterative refinement) while reducing dependence on costly offline retraining cycles. Key technical challenges include avoiding catastrophic forgetting, maintaining calibration and safety under autonomous updates, managing compute and data-efficiency trade-offs for on-device or low-latency adaptation, and constructing reliable feedback or reward signals that align short-term self-improvement with long-term objectives.

First used in community discourse around 2022–2023 as researchers and developers combined in-context learning, iterative self-correction, and agentic workflows; the term and its applications gained wider popularity in 2023–2025 alongside public interest in autonomous agent frameworks (e.g., Auto-GPT style systems), increased focus on prompt-based self-refinement, and publications exploring online/adaptive strategies for large pretrained models.

Key contributors include industrial labs that developed scalable pretrained LLMs and adaptation toolchains (OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic, Meta AI), academic researchers in meta-learning and continual learning (e.g., Chelsea Finn and colleagues for rapid adaptation paradigms), RL and control researchers whose methods underpin online policy updates and reward-driven refinement (e.g., work from groups including those around Sergey Levine and Pieter Abbeel), and the open-source and developer communities that popularized agentic and self-improving workflows (Auto-GPT, BabyAGI, communities producing iterative prompting and self-correction techniques).
