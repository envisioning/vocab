A feature spec (specification) serves as a detailed blueprint for developing an AI system or model, documenting the essential features, capabilities, and requirements it should possess. It bridges the gap between a project's business objectives and the technical team responsible for implementation by clarifying parameters such as input data types, expected outputs, performance metrics, constraints, and dependencies. The document plays a crucial role in the development lifecycle, guiding the engineering team and facilitating communication and understanding among stakeholders. In the context of AI and ML, feature specs ensure that algorithms and models are aligned with the intended use cases and that the systems are scalable, maintainable, and meet predefined success criteria.

The term "Feature Spec" emerged in the early 2000s as software development practices evolved to include more documentation and agile methodologies, gaining traction as AI projects became more complex.

While the exact originators of the feature spec concept are not well-documented, its development is closely tied to the growth of agile project management and software engineering practices, which many engineers and project managers have contributed to significantly.
