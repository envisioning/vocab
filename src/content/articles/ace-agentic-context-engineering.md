Agentic Context Engineering is the practice of intentionally crafting the situational inputs and interfaces (prompts, system roles, observation/action loops, tool APIs, memory scaffolds, and reward/feedback channels) that cause large language models and hybrid AI systems to operate as agents—planning, taking multi-step actions, invoking tools, and maintaining state—while bounding their behavior to desired objectives and constraints. It builds on prompt engineering and agent architectures (planner–executor, ReAct, chain-of-thought, RAG-based world models) to produce reliable, composable agentic behaviors in applications such as autonomous assistants, workflow automation, and multi-agent coordination. Techniques include hierarchical prompt templates, explicit instruction of policies, environmental framing that supplies relevant context, stateful memory design, tool-result shaping, and verifier or oracle calls for action validation; evaluation focuses on task completion, safety/constraint adherence, robustness under distributional shift, and interpretability of internal decision traces. From a theoretical perspective, ACE explores how contextual affordances transform latent model capabilities into structured agency, and it raises important alignment and safety considerations (goal misgeneralization, deceptive reasoning, unsafe tool invocation), necessitating human-in-the-loop controls, verifiable constraints, sandboxing, and reward/penalty shaping to mitigate risks.

Circa 2023: the concept emerged in practitioner and research discussions around agentic prompting and LLM-driven autonomous agents and gained broad attention in 2023–2024 alongside the rise of Auto-GPT/BabyAGI, tool-using agent frameworks, and formalizations of prompt‑and‑context design for safe, goal-directed AI.
