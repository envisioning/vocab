MCTS is a significant advancement in AI, renowned for its ability to handle complex decision-making problems with vast possibilities, primarily in gameplay like Go, Chess, and other strategic board games. The algorithm consists of four main steps: selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation, which allow it to evaluate a large number of potential actions without exhaustive examination. MCTS thrives in environments with deterministic outcomes where the possibility space is too large for traditional exhaustive search methods. It combines the precision of strategic exploration with the flexibility of random sampling, making it particularly valuable in optimizing NP-hard problems, improving reinforcement learning paradigms, and enhancing autonomous agents’ performance in uncertain environments.

First developed in 2006, MCTS gained prominence in 2016 with Google's AlphaGo defeating a professional Go player, demonstrating its effectiveness at tackling complex strategic games through AI.

Key contributors to the development of MCTS include the collective efforts of a group of researchers such as Rémi Coulom, who initially proposed the method, and others like Levente Kocsis and Csaba Szepesvári, whose work on the UCT (Upper Confidence Bound for Trees) algorithm was pivotal in consolidating MCTS's robustness and adaptability.
