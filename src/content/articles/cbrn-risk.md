CBRN Risk in the context of AI encompasses the assessment and management of threats posed by Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) agents that could potentially impact AI systems or their application domains. This risk evaluation is critical for the development and deployment of AI technologies, particularly in sectors such as defense, public safety, and healthcare, where exposure to CBRN scenarios could significantly disrupt operations or compromise data integrity. AI tools often assist in CBRN risk modeling by leveraging predictive analytics, natural language processing, and ML algorithms to simulate potential threat scenarios, enhance situational awareness, and enable proactive measures. Such integration emphasizes the need for robust AI frameworks capable of operating reliably under CBRN circumstances while safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring operational continuity.

CBRN-related terms gained prominence in the mid-20th century, initially in military contexts, with increased application in AI emerging in the early 2000s to address evolving global security challenges, as innovations in AI offered advanced predictive and analytic capabilities.

Key contributors to the understanding and development of CBRN risk in AI include interdisciplinary teams comprising experts in AI, defense technology, and environmental science, with significant research stemming from institutions like DARPA and NATO, as they drive innovation in integrating AI to mitigate CBRN threats.
