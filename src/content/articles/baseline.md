In AI, a baseline is a critical component used to measure the effectiveness and advancement of models or algorithms. Serving as a standard point of comparison, it helps researchers and practitioners assess the performance gains achieved when new models are developed. A baseline can be a simple heuristic or a well-established method that offers a minimum acceptable performance level against which more advanced techniques are evaluated. The ability to define a proper baseline is crucial for meaningful comparisons, ensuring that any observed performance improvements are genuinely attributed to new model innovations rather than variations or outliers in data or minor circumstantial enhancements. In practice, establishing a baseline involves selecting a straightforward, often simplistic model that reflects a conventional or previously known solution, enabling clear measurement of model improvements and innovations.

The concept of a baseline in AI first emerged in the 1980s with the increasing need to evaluate new algorithms against existing ones objectively. It gained prominence in the 1990s and early 2000s, especially with the rise of ML competitions and benchmarks that required standard evaluation metrics for fair assessments.

The development and popularization of baselines in AI can be attributed to the broader academic and research community striving for methodological standards. Researchers like Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yoshua Bengio contributed significantly to the field by emphasizing the need for rigorous benchmarks and comparisons in their pioneering works on neural networks and deep learning. Their collective efforts in defining and utilizing baselines have helped establish a robust framework for algorithm evaluation in modern AI research.
