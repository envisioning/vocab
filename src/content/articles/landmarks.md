In AI, particularly within the field of computer vision, landmarks refer to specific, identifiable points on an object or within an image that are used to help systems understand, interpret, and analyze visual information. These landmarks are critical for a variety of applications, such as facial recognition, where they can help identify the positions of the eyes, nose, and mouth to create a mathematical model of the face. By mapping these landmarks, AI systems can perform tasks like facial verification, expression analysis, or even 3D modeling with greater accuracy and efficiency. Landmarks simplify the complex task of understanding visual data by providing a structured way to extract and represent relevant features, enabling more effective model training and real-time processing.

The use of landmarks in AI gained traction with the advent of facial recognition technologies in the 1990s, although the concept can be traced back to earlier image processing techniques in the 1980s, when computational power reached a level where complex visual pattern recognition became feasible. They became particularly popular in the 2000s with the rise of digital photography and biometric systems.

Key contributors to the development of the concept of landmarks include researchers in the fields of computer vision and AI, such as Matthew Turk and Alex Pentland, whose work in the early 1990s on the Eigenfaces approach laid the groundwork for facial recognition systems utilizing facial landmarks.
