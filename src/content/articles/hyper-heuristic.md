Hyper-heuristics are an innovative domain within AI that focus on developing frameworks or systems capable of selecting or generating heuristics to tackle complex optimization problems. Unlike traditional heuristics designed to address specific problem instances, hyper-heuristics operate on a meta-level by creating methodology to either choose existing heuristics or construct new ones dynamically based on feedback from the search process. This adaptability makes hyper-heuristics particularly valuable in domains where problem characteristics may vary widely or are not well understood enough to design effective singular heuristics. They have been employed effectively in diverse fields such as scheduling, timetabling, and various resource allocation tasks, often outperforming bespoke heuristic solutions by leveraging generality and flexibility.

The term "hyper-heuristic" first surfaced in academic literature circa the early 2000s, but the concept gained more substantial traction during the mid to late 2000s. This rise in popularity coincided with the increasing computational power and data availability, which facilitated the research and application of more adaptive and scalable search strategies.

Key contributors to the development of hyper-heuristics include researchers like Edmund Burke and Graham Kendall, whose pioneering work laid down the foundation for randomized selection and generation of heuristics. Their significant contributions have broadly shaped the methodologies and theoretical underpinnings of adaptive search algorithms.
