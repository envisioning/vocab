Graphs are a pivotal concept in AI, providing a flexible structure to represent complex networks of relationships and data interactions. They are employed in numerous AI applications, including social network analysis, recommendation systems, and knowledge graphs, due to their ability to efficiently model intricate relationships. Graph-based ML techniques, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), have gained traction for tasks requiring the processing of non-Euclidean data structures. These techniques enable the extraction of patterns and insights from data that are inherently relational, allowing for advanced capabilities in domains like molecular chemistry, transport logistics, and fraud detection. By leveraging the inherent connectedness of graphs, AI systems can perform sophisticated inference and prediction tasks that go beyond traditional linear models.

Graphs have been used in mathematical contexts for centuries, with Euler's work on the Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg in 1736 as a foundational point. Their application in computer science began in earnest in the mid-20th century, with their popularity in AI rising in parallel with the development of algorithms that could efficiently handle graph structures, especially ones focused on network theory and data representation.

Key contributors to the development and popularization of graph theory in AI include mathematicians like Leonhard Euler and computer scientists who have applied these concepts to AI systems, such as John McCarthy and Geoffrey Hinton. Their pioneering work laid the groundwork for numerous areas within computational graph theory and its applications in neural networks and deep learning.
