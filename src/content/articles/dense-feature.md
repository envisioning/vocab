Dense features are crucial to AI and ML tasks as they efficiently encapsulate comprehensive information per feature, allowing models to recognize patterns and relationships within data without sparse representations slowing computations. Unlike sparse features, where many feature values are zero and carry little immediate information, dense features provide a compact, information-rich representation that is ideal for neural networks and various deep learning techniques. They are particularly valuable in scenarios such as word embeddings in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where each word is represented as a dense vector in a fixed-sized continuous vector space, thus capturing semantic relationships. By representing data in a dense feature space, models can gain a richer contextual understanding, leading to improved performance in tasks like image recognition, speech processing, and recommendation systems.

The term "dense feature" began to gain traction in academic and industry circles around the mid-2010s as deep learning became more prevalent, with the specific context often linked to advancements in NLP and computer vision requiring more detailed feature representations.

Researchers like Tomas Mikolov contributed significantly to the practical adoption and popularity of dense features, especially through the development of word2vec, which showcased the effectiveness of dense feature representations by transforming words into dense vectors that capture semantic similarities.
