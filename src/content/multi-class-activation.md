title: Multi-Class Activation
---

Multi-Class Activation refers to the technique used in Machine Learning (ML) algorithms dealing with multi-class classification problems. In such problems, an instance or input may belong to more than two categories or classes. This contrasts with binary activation which only allows for two possible outcomes, commonly known as '0' and '1' or 'true' and 'false'. A common type of Multi-Class Activation is the Softmax function, which gives the probability distribution of the result over multiple classes. It's significant as it aids in improved accuracy and in handling complex ML tasks where data classification isn't binary.

Historical overview: Multi-Class Activation is a fundamental part of ML and has been used since the early stages of neural networks development. Although there isn't a specific date of its first use, the introduction and popularization of neural network models in the 1980s and 1990s likely marked its more frequent application.

Key contributors: The concept of Multi-Class Activation is a collective advancement, contributed towards by many scholars and practitioners in the field of AI and ML. These include researchers and developers who have worked on the construction of advanced AI models and neural networks.
