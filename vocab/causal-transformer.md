---

The Causal Transformer is a cutting-edge development in the field of AI, specifically in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and time series forecasting. It is a type of Transformer, a popular model in deep learning, that is designed to understand the causality in sequences of data. Instead of treating data as independent or randomly ordered, it probes the information for cause-effect relationships, which can significantly improve performance on tasks that involve predicting future events based on past data. Its applications range from language translation, text summarization, and speech recognition to financial forecasting and music generation.

Historical overview: The Transformer model was first described in a 2017 paper, "Attention is All You Need", and has since become a dominant model in NLP due in part to its effectiveness and scalability. The concept of a Causal Transformer builds on the success of the original Transformer, incorporating a more nuanced understanding of time and sequence dependencies.

Key contributors: While a number of AI researchers have contributed to the development and refinement of the Transformer model, the "Attention is All You Need" paper was authored by a team from Google Brain, including Vaswani, Shazeer, Parmar, Uszkoreit, Jones, Gomez, Kaiser, and Polosukhin. The concept of a Causal Transformer reflects the ongoing efforts of many in the AI community to improve and expand upon these foundational models.
