title: Cooperativity
summary: How multiple agents or components work together in a system to achieve better performance or solutions than they could individually.

**2. Detailed Explanation**:  
Cooperativity in AI is a key concept in multi-agent systems (MAS) and distributed AI, where multiple autonomous agents or subsystems collaborate to solve complex tasks. These agents may be software programs, robots, or decision-making entities. Cooperativity can improve task efficiency, adaptability, and robustness, as agents can share information, distribute workloads, or develop cooperative strategies for complex problems, such as in swarm intelligence or team-based reinforcement learning. Importantly, cooperativity often involves balancing collaborative behaviors with competitive dynamics (like resource sharing or limited knowledge) to optimize overall system performance. For example, in cooperative AI for autonomous vehicles, each car coordinates its movements with others to avoid accidents and optimize traffic flow.

**3. Historical Overview**:  
The concept of cooperativity in AI dates back to the early development of multi-agent systems in the 1980s, gaining traction with the rise of distributed AI in the 1990s. The growing complexity of real-world AI applications, particularly in areas like robotics and autonomous systems, has fueled its popularity in recent decades.
