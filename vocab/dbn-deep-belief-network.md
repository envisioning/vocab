  layers of latent variables, or hidden units.
title: (DBN) Deep Belief Network
---

A Deep Belief Network (DBN) is associated with advancements in AI and forms the backbone for many applications including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. These networks utilize a stack of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), or auto-encoders to create a generative, probabilistic model. The primary advantage of DBNs lies in their ability to perform unsupervised learning -- they can learn from unlabelled data, discover intricate data structure, and generate new data that is similar to the input data.

Historical Overview: The revolutionary concept of DBNs was introduced by Geoffrey Hinton and his students in 2006. The innovation quickly garnered popularity in the field of AI, because it enabled training deep neural networks, a previously challenging task.

Key Contributors: AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton played an influential role in the development of DBNs. Alongside him, his students Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun made significant contributions to refining the concept and its applications.
