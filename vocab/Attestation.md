Attestation typically involves a trusted entity validating that a system is operating as expected by checking hardware, software, or data integrity. In AI, attestation is becoming crucial in trustworthy AI systems, where the goal is to ensure that models and data have not been altered maliciously or inadvertently. This verification can be performed locally (self-attestation) or remotely (remote attestation), often relying on cryptographic techniques and secure hardware like Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs). Attestation strengthens security in distributed AI systems, IoT, and cloud-based AI solutions by confirming that devices or models meet certain security standards before granting access or operational privileges.

The concept of attestation emerged in the early 2000s, especially in the context of secure computing and Trusted Computing technologies, where attestation became central to guaranteeing that systems were running approved, secure software.

Key contributors include organizations like the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), which developed standards for TPMs, and companies like Intel and Microsoft that have integrated attestation technologies into their hardware and software products.
