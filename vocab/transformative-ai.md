title: Transformative AI
---

**Detailed Explanation:**  
Transformative AI is a concept used to describe AI systems that have the ability to drastically reshape key societal structures or industries due to their advanced capabilities. This class of AI could lead to changes comparable to those of the Industrial Revolution or the Information Age, but on a potentially larger scale. Transformative AI systems are expected to surpass current specialized AI systems in scope, impacting areas such as healthcare, labor markets, governance, and scientific research. It encompasses scenarios where AI not only automates tasks but also creates new forms of value, introduces radical efficiencies, and addresses complex problems at a scale humans could not achieve alone. A major focus in this area is ensuring that the development of transformative AI remains beneficial and aligned with human values, given the vast potential for both positive and negative outcomes.

**Historical Overview:**  
The term "transformative AI" started gaining prominence in the early 2010s as discussions around the long-term societal impact of AI intensified. The idea became more mainstream as advances in machine learning, especially deep learning, showed the potential for AI to disrupt industries and global structures.

**Key Contributors:**  
Significant contributors to the concept include organizations like OpenAI and DeepMind, which focus on developing advanced AI technologies. Thought leaders like Nick Bostrom and Stuart Russell have also been instrumental in raising awareness about the societal impact of transformative AI, particularly through their work on AI safety and ethics.
