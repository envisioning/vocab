A Decision Support System (DSS) is an interactive, flexible, and adaptable computer-based information system that utilizes analytical models and data to assist in the decision-making process. It is typically employed for strategic and management level decisions. It helps to evaluate complex alternatives based on different variables. DSS can incorporate various types of models and data, including descriptive models, what-if analysis, optimization algorithms, and AI elements.

Historical Overview: The term itself emerged in the mid-1970s when researchers such as Michael Scott Morton and others at the MIT Sloan School of Management began exploring the use of computer systems in improving decision processes of planning and management.

Key Contributors: Many researchers and experts have contributed to refining the concept and technologies of DSS, including Peter Keen, who helped evolve DSS terminologies and methodologies in the early stages. Later, with the advent of AI and ML, researchers like Lotfi A. Zadeh and various others have contributed to integrating these advanced technologies into DSS, thereby enhancing their prediction and decision-making abilities.
