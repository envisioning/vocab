title: AI Safety
---

AI Safety focuses on minimizing the potential risks associated with AI and ensuring that when AI systems are developed, they align with human values and interests. In the rapidly evolving world of technology, AI Safety has become increasingly significant to prevent misuse of AI systems or disasters arising from advanced AI behavior, which was originally unintended. As AI systems become more powerful and pervasive, the need for AI safety also becomes more prominent. This involves research and techniques, such as robustness, interpretability, and alignment, which ensure the safe operation of AI systems.

While discussions about the ramifications of AI date back to its inception in the mid-20th century, AI Safety as a distinct field of research started to emerge in the late 1990s. However, it garnered significant attention in recent years due to the rapid advancements in AI and growing apprehensions about their potential impacts.

Key contributors to the field of AI Safety include Nick Bostrom, known for his work on existential risk; Eliezer Yudkowsky, a decision theorist who advocates for friendly AI; and the late Stuart Russell, the author of a leading AI textbook who has spoken extensively about the need for better strategies to handle AI's power. Institutions focusing on AI safety research include the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, the Future of Life Institute, and OpenAI.
