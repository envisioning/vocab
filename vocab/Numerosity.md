Numerosity is a principle in AI tied to the comprehension of the quantitative aspects of a data set or collection, especially paying attention to the volume of elements. This term is dutifully employed in Machine Learning (ML) and deep learning models. A significant challenge in dealing with data in ML is numerosity reduction, which involves techniques to reduce the volume of data without losing vital information. These techniques can tackle the issue of storage space, computing power, and algorithmic efficiency. High numerosity can lead to higher computational complexity and can also lead to overfitting in supervised learning models. Therefore understanding and handling numerosity is crucial for effective and efficient ML models.

The concept of numerosity, while a primary staple of basic arithmetic and mathematical cognition, found its applicability in AI and particularly ML in the late 20th century with the advancement of computational units and introduction of big data. Modern data sets can contain billions or even trillions of examples, increasing the pertinence of the concept in today's computing world.

Key contributors to the applications and techniques of handling numerosity in AI and ML include but are not limited to Leo Breiman, Jerome H. Friedman, and their teams who developed techniques such as random forests and gradient boosting machines, which can handle high volumes of data effectively. Furthermore, the work of Vladimir N. Vapnik and Alexey Ya. Chervonenkis in developing the Vapnikâ€“Chervonenkis theory significantly contributed to understanding the concept of numerosity and overfitting in statistical learning theory.
