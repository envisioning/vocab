Sample difficulty is an important aspect of AI, specifically in supervised learning scenarios. It refers to the variance in complexity of particular samples or data points in a dataset, impacting how easily a model can accurately predict them. Essentially, some samples may prove more difficult for a model to learn than others. Factors contributing to sample difficulty might include data quality, diversity, or inherent ambiguity. Recognizing and addressing sample difficulty is crucial in enhancing the performance of AI models.

Historical overview: Though the concept of sample difficulty is intrinsic to all learning systems, conscious consideration and formal discussions regarding 'sample difficulty' in the context of AI and ML emerged in research during the late 20th and early 21st century, as computational models became sophisticated enough to discern such intricacies.

Key contributors: It is challenging to pinpoint specific individuals who significantly contributed to the concept of sample difficulty. Nevertheless, it is a collaborative product of the AI and ML academic and professional communities' evolving understanding of data and model complexities. Contribution to this concept is ongoing, as researchers and data scientists continue to explore techniques to address sample difficulty in diverse domains.
