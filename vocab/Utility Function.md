A Utility Function in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a measurement of the satisfaction or preference of an agent. In basic terms, it is a mathematical function that allows a machine to rank various outcomes or state of the world based on the level of 'utility' or satisfaction they provide. This function is key to making decisions in AI, used to predict and calculate the best possible action that an AI system or agent should take based on expected outcomes. It's through this function that AI agents are trained to choose actions that maximize the expected utility.

Historical overview: Utility Functions have their roots in classical economic theory, dating back to the 18th century with the work of Daniel Bernoulli. They were introduced into the field of AI as part of decision theory - a field that gained popularity in the mid-20th century. The use of utility functions in AI, specifically, picks up in the late 20th century, as they become integral to the development of advanced decision-making systems.

Key contributors: Daniel Bernoulli is a significant figure in the early conceptualization of the utility function in economic theory. In the realm of AI, notable figures include Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, who in their seminal book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" provide comprehensive explanation and application of utility functions in AI.
