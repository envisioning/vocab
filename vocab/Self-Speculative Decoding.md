Self-Speculative Decoding (SSD) is an influential step in sequential decision making problems, prominent in AI disciplines such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). SSD enriches decoding capability by generating predictions of future parts in the sequence, enabling a system to leverage contextual foresight to improve prediction accuracy. This allows AI systems to construct more accurate and well-formed outputs compared to standard decoding methods.

Historical overview: Although the exact inception of SSD is not clearly specified, it arose out of the need to enhance text generation techniques in NLP and better action selection in RL, gradually gaining recognition in the AI community in the last decade.

Key contributors: The advancement and use of SSD have been the outcomes of cumulative research contributions from scientists across AI subfields, with no one individual being primarily credited for its development. However, research groups working on NLP and RL at leading tech firms and institutes have significantly contributed to refining and utilizing this concept.
