title: Agglomerative Clustering
---

Agglomerative Clustering is an important concept in the fields of AI and Machine Learning (ML). This technique falls under hierarchical clustering methods that operate by grouping data points into larger clusters based on certain similarity measures. At start, each data point is considered a separate cluster. The algorithm then progressively merges the clusters that are closest together based on specified metrics, such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance. This process continues until there is only one single cluster left, hence creating a hierarchical tree of clusters, also known as a dendrogram. This method facilitates a multilevel breakdown of data sets, which can be highly useful in exploratory data analysis, pattern recognition, and image processing.

Historical overview: Although the origin and early usage of Agglomerative Clustering are hard to precisely decipher, it's generally agreed that this technique started to gain prominence in AI and ML with the emergence and rise of computer-driven data analysis in the latter half of the 20th century. Its usage became particularly popular with the increasing demand for efficient methods to deal with large and complex data sets in various industries.

Key contributors: The development of Agglomerative Clustering has been greatly shaped by contributions from different researchers and practitioners in the field of computer science, statistics and AI over the years. However, attributing its development or evolution to a single individual or group is complex and has been largely an accumulative and collaborative effort of the scientific community.
