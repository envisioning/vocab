Fact-Checking AI refers to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to automate the process of verifying the accuracy of statements, claims, and news. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and other AI techniques, these systems can parse massive amounts of data and cross-reference details against reliable databases or knowledge bases much faster than human fact-checkers. Not only can they identify false or misleading information, but advanced solutions can often provide the source or context of the information that has been checked. These systems are often used to combat misinformation and disinformation on the internet, especially in the realm of social media and news platforms.

Fact-checking by AI systems picked up momentum with the rise of social media and subsequent challenges with fake news. While manual fact-checking has been around for several years, the application of AI for this process emerged prominently around the mid-2010s. With the proliferation of information on the internet and the increasing risk of misinformation, the use of Fact-Checking AI has become more relevant and important.

Key contributors in the evolution of Fact-Checking AI include technology companies like Google and Facebook, which have integrated fact-checking algorithms into their platforms. Major universities and research institutions like MIT and Stanford have also contributed by developing sophisticated AI technologies and conducting research in NLP and ML that make automated fact-checking possible.
