## ML framework that divides a complex problem into parts, solved by specialized models (experts), and integrates their solutions.

### Detailed Explanation:

The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model is a form of ensemble learning that aims to improve prediction accuracy and model flexibility by combining the strengths of multiple specialized models, referred to as "experts." Each expert is trained to handle a specific subset of the data or a particular aspect of the problem. A gating network, another crucial component of the MoE architecture, determines the weighting of each expert's contribution to the final output based on the input data. This approach allows MoE to adaptively allocate computational resources and expertise depending on the complexity and diversity of the task at hand. It is particularly effective in scenarios where the data encompasses a wide variety of patterns that no single model could efficiently capture, offering a scalable and dynamic solution for complex machine learning challenges.

### Historical Overview:

The concept of Mixture-of-Experts was introduced by Jacobs et al. in 1991. It gained popularity as a flexible and powerful method for tackling complex machine learning problems that benefit from specialized knowledge and adaptability.

### Key Contributors:

- **Robert Jacobs** is one of the primary contributors to the development of the Mixture-of-Experts model, having co-authored the seminal paper that introduced the framework.
- **Michael I. Jordan**, a prominent figure in machine learning and cognitive science, has also made significant contributions to the development and understanding of MoE models, especially in the context of hierarchical mixtures of experts (HME) and their applications.
