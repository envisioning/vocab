summary: Flexible framework designed for building multimodal AI-powered systems that
  interact with users through a variety of inputs (like text, voice, and more) and
  outputs, while incorporating advanced reasoning capabilities. The name xRx stands
  for "any input (x), reasoning (R), any output (x)," emphasizing its versatility
  in handling different interaction modalities and integrating reasoning across complex
  domains.
title: xRx

### Expert-Level Explanation:
xRx enables developers to create AI systems capable of seamless real-time interaction across multiple forms of communication—text, voice, audio, and visual elements. It integrates components like speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and reasoning agents, which allow the system to convert inputs (e.g., voice commands) into actionable information, process it with sophisticated reasoning algorithms, and produce multimodal outputs (e.g., a spoken response or a text summary). A key feature of xRx is its ability to handle low-latency inference, essential for natural, real-time AI interactions, making it particularly suited for applications like AI assistants, customer service bots, and adaptive learning environments.

### Historical Overview:
The xRx framework was introduced in the early 2020s as a response to the growing need for AI systems that can manage complex, live interactions in real-time across various industries. It gained prominence as an open-source project backed by developers from **8090 Solutions**, leveraging technologies like Groq® LPU™ for low-latency AI processing.

### Key Contributors:
The development of xRx is driven by **8090 Solutions**, a group focused on creating AI technologies that redefine user experience by integrating multimodal inputs and outputs. Their use of **Groq® LPU™** (Latency Processing Units) accelerates AI inference, making it ideal for real-time applications.
