title: Activation Data
summary: Intermediate outputs produced by neurons in a neural network when processing input data, which are used to evaluate and update the network during training.

**Expert-Level Explanation:** Activation data is the set of values generated by the activation functions of a neural network's neurons as input passes through the network layers. These activations capture how much each neuron "fires" in response to particular inputs, playing a critical role in determining the network's final output. During training, these activations are central to the backpropagation process, as they are used to compute gradients and update the model’s weights. Activation data is also vital in debugging and understanding how models operate internally, enabling interpretability methods such as feature attribution and saliency mapping. Efficient handling of activation data is crucial, as its storage can become memory-intensive, especially in large models.

**Historical Overview:** The concept of activation data emerged alongside the development of artificial neural networks in the 1940s-50s, but it became more formally important with the rise of deep learning in the 2010s. The widespread use of backpropagation in the 1980s brought focus to the importance of tracking activations to adjust weights.

**Key Contributors:** Key contributors include Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, who laid the foundation of neural networks in 1943, and Geoffrey Hinton, David Rumelhart, and Ronald J. Williams, who popularized backpropagation in the 1980s, solidifying the role of activations in training neural networks.
