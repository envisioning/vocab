Quantum computing is a rapidly growing field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to execute computations. Unlike traditional computers which use bits (0s and 1s) to process information, quantum computers use quantum bits, or "qubits", which can exist in multiple states at once. This attribute, known as superposition, combined with the concept of "entanglement", a phenomenon where particles become interconnected and the state of one instantly influences the others, allows quantum computers to process large amounts of data at exponentially higher speeds than traditional computers. It has significant implications for AI and ML, because the power of quantum computing could potentially expedite data processing and complex computations, thereby accelerating the learning process of AI models and enabling breakthroughs in areas such as natural language processing, image recognition, and predictive analytics.

Historical overview: The term "quantum computing" was first introduced in the early 1980s by physicist Paul Benioff who is credited with first applying quantum theory to computers. Quantum computing gained popularity in the 1990s after Peter Shor developed Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm for factoring large numbers exponentially faster than the best known classical algorithm.

Key contributors: Several key figures have contributed to the development of quantum computing. Paul Benioff and Richard Feynman proposed the idea of a quantum computer in the 1980s. Peter Shor further popularised the field by formulating Shor's algorithm. Quantum computing has also been significantly propelled by tech giants like IBM, Google and Microsoft investing heavily in developing this nascent technology. These companies, along with numerous start-ups and academic researchers worldwide, continue to play a pivotal role in advancing the field.
