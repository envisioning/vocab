title: nGPT (Normalized Transformer)
---

The Normalized Transformer (nGPT) is a new twist on the transformer architecture that normalizes the input before it's processed by the model. This tweak substantially enhances training efficiency and improves the robustness of the model. Normalized transformers are especially valuable in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks where large-scale, high-dimensional data is typical. They contribute to more accurate translations, more coherent text generation and better context understanding among other applications.

Historically, the concept of normalized transformers was born out of modifications to the original GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) models, which have shaped the field of NLP since their introduction in 2018 by OpenAI. The idea behind nGPT evolved as AI research concentrated on modifying the inner workings of transformer (a type of deep learning model) structures to achieve superior performance.

Key contributors to the advancement of the Normalized Transformer concept include various AI researchers and groups. Prominent among them is OpenAI, a leading AI research laboratory consisting of the for-profit arm OpenAI LP and its parent company, the non-profit OpenAI Inc. OpenAI has contributed enormously to the transformer model's development with a focus on publicly available models like GPT and its iterations.
