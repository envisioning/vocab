An Exploit Generator is a tool, typically used within the field of cybersecurity, that leverages AI capabilities to detect vulnerabilities in a system and automatically develop exploits for those weaknesses. Its functionality is based on the principles of machine learning, where the generator learns to identify vulnerabilities from a dataset and then uses that learned knowledge to scan a system, pinpoint weaknesses, and formulate exploits for these weak points. This automation makes the process faster and more efficient, which can be beneficial for cybersecurity experts seeking to strengthen their systems, but poses potential dangers if used maliciously.

The term 'Exploit Generator' came into use in the late 1980s and early 1990s when AI started to become more integrated into cybersecurity practices. The development of exploit generators came as a response to the increasing complexity of software, which made manual vulnerability scanning and exploit generation time-consuming and complex.

Key contributors to the advancement of exploit generators include the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which spearheaded the Cyber Grand Challenge in 2016. This competition, where automated systems tested their abilities to find and patch software vulnerabilities, played a significant role in the evolution of AI use in cybersecurity, including the development of exploit generators.
