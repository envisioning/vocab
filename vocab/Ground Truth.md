Ground Truth is a crucial aspect of AI and ML training process; it functions as a baseline or benchmark that ML algorithms rely on for training and evaluation. The integrity of any ML model is a direct function of the quality of the Ground Truth it's based on. Applications range across various sectors: for instance, in computer vision, Ground Truth could be the actual objects in an image; in Natural Language Processing, it could be the specific classification of texts. It's used to assess the accuracy or effectiveness of a model by comparing the model's prediction results with the Ground Truth.

Historical overview: The term 'Ground Truth' originated from the field of geostatistics around the mid-20th century to denote measurements taken on location ("on the ground"). It gained popularity in AI and ML in the 21st century as the need for data verification and model validation gained importance with growing AI applications.

Key contributors: While specific attribution is challenging due to the generic nature of the term, its application and evolution in the context of AI and ML have been championed by AI pioneers and researchers worldwide to ensure accuracy and robustness in model training and evaluation.
