In modern usage, the term "Clanker" has gained attention in the context of AI automation and robotics, particularly as a symbol of resistance against job displacement caused by machines. It has also emerged in meme culture, where it reflects the frustrations of workers who feel threatened by AI's increasing role in industries traditionally dominated by humans. The term can be viewed as a reflection of broader societal concerns over the growing role of artificial intelligence and robotics, representing fears of dehumanization and loss of control over technological advancements​.

Historically, "Clanker" derives from older slang, originally referring to something that produces a clanking noise, likely tied to industrial machinery. In its AI-related context, it gained traction around the mid-2010s to 2020s, as public discourse around automation and AI became more pronounced.

The popularization of "Clanker" in AI contexts has not been driven by a single individual but has evolved through collective social media use and cultural discussions, with the rise of meme-driven movements and cryptocurrencies like "Clanker Coin" exemplifying this shift​.
