## Algorithms that predict the next element in a sequence, pivotal for tasks in natural language processing (NLP) such as text generation and translation.

### Detailed Explanation:

Sequence models are foundational to NLP as they capture the sequential nature of language, allowing for the understanding and generation of text based on prior context. These models utilize historical data points within a sequence (e.g., words in a sentence) to predict future data points, making them essential for tasks like machine translation, speech recognition, and text summarization. Techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and more recently, Transformer models, fall under this category. These models have dramatically improved the ability of machines to comprehend and produce human-like text, leveraging the sequential dependencies within the data to enhance prediction accuracy and context relevance.

### Historical Overview:

Sequence models, particularly in the form of RNNs, have been explored since the 1980s, with significant advancements in the 1990s. However, their application in NLP saw a substantial leap forward with the introduction of LSTMs in 1997, designed to address the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs. The Transformer model, introduced in 2017, further revolutionized the field by enabling parallel processing of sequences and significantly improving performance on a wide range of NLP tasks.

### Key Contributors:

- The LSTM model, addressing long-term dependencies in sequences, was developed by Sepp Hochreiter and JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber in 1997.
- The Transformer model, which introduced attention mechanisms to improve sequence modeling, was proposed by Ashish Vaswani and colleagues in the paper "Attention is All You Need" in 2017. These developments have been instrumental in shaping the current landscape of NLP and sequence modeling.
