title: "Random Forest"
summary: "An ensemble ML technique that leverages multiple decision trees to enhance predictive performance and prevent overfitting."

Random Forest is an influential and highly versatile Machine Learning algorithm known for providing accurate results, primarily due to the collective 'wisdom' of multiple decision trees. Essentially, it creates several decision trees, each designed to predict the possible outcome. The final prediction is a function of every individual tree's prediction, usually the mode for classification and average for regression problems. Such ensemble approach helps to overcome single decision tree’s shortcomings like propensity to overfit and high sensitivity to training data specifics. Random Forests are applied in various fields including image classification, medical diagnoses and even in banking for identifying loyal customers and fraud detection.

Historically, the Random Forest algorithm was first introduced in 1996 as an extension to decision trees. However, it truly gained popularity in the Machine Learning community in 2001, due to Leo Breiman’s paper, "Random Forests".

The key contributors to the development of the Random Forest algorithm include Tin Kam Ho, who initially proposed Random Decision Forests in 1995, and Leo Breiman, who made significant improvements and popularized the algorithm with his 2001 paper. Their work has been instrumental in transforming this technique into one of the most powerful and widely-used Machine Learning tools today.
